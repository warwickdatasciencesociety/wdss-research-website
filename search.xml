        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>We have all heard the expression of a &quot;one-hit wonder,” but what is it exactly? Wikipedia sums it up perfectly: &quot;[A] “one-hit wonder” is any entity that achieves mainstream popularity, often for only one piece of work, and becomes known among the general public solely for that momentary success.” Our research regards, examines and presents some of the biggest “one-hit wonders” over the last few decades. For the purposes of this experiment, we have declared an artist a one-hit wonder based upon the number of their Spotify streams.</p><h2 id="Methodology">Methodology</h2><p>We collected data from Spotify via the Spotify API for 20 famous artists who could most likely be considered as “one-hit wonders.” The collected data includes the five most streamed songs of each artist, the number of Spotify streams of each song, and the date and the audio features of the two most streamed songs of each artist. The audio features include different characteristics, such as: “dance-ability,” loudness, or tempo. This research will be presented via various sections which aim to enlighten certain aspects of these artists and their songs.<br>The first section is intending to show that these artists are, indeed, “one-hit wonders.”</p><h2 id="Data-Analysis">Data Analysis</h2><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_3_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>As displayed above, the plot compares the number of Spotify streams of the first and second most popular songs of 10 of the selected artists. Huge differences can be seen for each occasion as none of these artist have ever come close to the success of their biggest hit.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_5_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Next, we ranked the five most popular songs of every artist, and then averaged the number of Spotify streams of each rank (which is shown in the next plot). The first ranked songs averaged close to 200 million streams while the second ranked songs stayed below 25 million. 3rd to the 5th ranked songs lag far behind this number. This plot further reinforces that these artist had only one outstanding performance over their career.</p><p>We tried to investigate whether there is a difference in the number of “one-hit wonder” artists over the decades, particularly between 1969 and 2000 - the date of the oldest and newest “one-hit wonders” in our research.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_7_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>We can see that there is not a strong correlation regarding the distribution of such artists over time. While the relatively small number of data can also have an effect upon this result, the obvious explanation is that the prevalence of “one-hit wonders” does not depend on the era as there were, and will always be, such performers.</p><p>We may have the assumption that “one-hit wonder” artists generally release their biggest hit early in their career and then they try to recreate it, typically without success. Hence, we checked whether the second most popular songs usually came later than the most popular songs or not.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_9_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>The plot above lightly supports this claim. The straight line is a y=x line, where y and x are the date of the second most and the most popular songs respectively. We can see that more points are above the line than below, which means that the big hits were most likely to be followed by the second biggest hit rather than vice versa. After we fitted a linear model, we can see that the representative plot line is above the straight line, so the general trend is what we expected.</p><p>We investigated the audio features of the songs to figure out why the famous songs became famous and, alteratively, why the other songs of the particular artist didn’t. We compared the audio features of the two most popular songs of each artist, expecting that one feature, i.e.: “dance-ability” will be generally higher for the most popular one than the second most popular one. Surprisingly, we rarely found such patterns.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_12_0.png"  alt=""></p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_13_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>The closest we got to this hypothesis were in regards to the “liveness” and the “dance-ability” of the songs, of which the most popular ones increasingly had higher scores than the second most popular ones, as seen above. However, the trend is not so strong here, and pure luck could have had an effect. So, it seems that none of the audio features explain the reason behind their success.</p><p>Finally, we examined the extent to which each “one-hit wonder” artist technically is a “one-hit wonder,” which was a value we got by dividing the Spotify stream count of the most popular songs by the stream count of the second most popular songs from each artist.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/one-hit-wonders/one-hit-wonders_15_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>As we can see, Norman Greenbaum is a real “one-hit wonder,” with a stream count more than 850 times higher for his biggest hit than for his second biggest hit. On the other hand, Billy Paul or Vanilla Ice had other songs which were relatively popular.</p><h2 id="Conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>We hope that our project demonstrated some interesting characteristics of 20 of the most famous “one-hit wonder” artists. While most of these artists are not currently active, some of them are, and they may produce another hit and then successfully erase the title “one-hit wonder” from themselves, hence resign their place from our list.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Oh Hell! - Reinforcement Learning for solving card games</title>
      <link href="/oh-hell/"/>
      <url>/oh-hell/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>This post is the corresponding write-up for a WDSS project in which Albert Nyarko-Agyei, Alexandru Pascru and Ron Cvek applied reinforcement learning to better understand the mechanics of a British card game—<i>Oh Hell</i>. The rules and an online version of the game can be found <a href="https://cardgames.io/ohhell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Special credits to Henry Charlesworth for providing valuable insights. The main author of the project and the blog-post is Albert Nyarko-Agyei.</p></div><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The idea for this project started when I was introduced to the game, <i>Oh Hell</i>, by one of the contributors to the project. We played a variation where each player is given 7 cards and then the players take it in turn to predict how many rounds they will win. Interestingly, predicting correctly gives you extra points or ‘tricks.’ So, if many games are being played, a good prediction strategy is needed.</p><p>After bidding, the round starts with the player to the left of the dealer playing a card from their hand. Each player then has to play a card from the same suit if they have one, otherwise any card from their hand is permissible. Once everyone has played a card, the player who played the highest card from the first suit wins the round, gets a trick added to their total, and starts the next round. Two caveats to these rules are:</p><ol><li><p>Along with dealing cards for the game, a trump card is drawn and if a card from with the same suit is played, it will beat every other suit.</p></li><li><p>The number of tricks bid by the last bidder can not make the total number of tricks bid equal to the number of cards dealt to each player.</p></li></ol><p>Now that we have the rules down, some different strategies might have come across your mind. Horde your trump cards till the end? Bid a low number of tricks? Bid a high number of tricks because you’re confident? What is the perfect strategy to this game? Turning to AI and Reinforcement Learning seemed a logical way to answer these questions.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: There are two main themes in this project, the programming of agents/models, and the theory behind why certain methods work; feel free to pick which sections interest you.</p><h2 id="The-Approach">The Approach</h2><p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> is a branch of Machine Learning that deals with the <strong>actions</strong> an <strong>agent(s)</strong> should take based on it’s <strong>observation</strong> of an <strong>environment</strong> in order to maximise a <strong>reward</strong>. If our environment is a simple <i>Oh Hell</i> game, we can formulate our problem as designing an agent to predict what action will give the most reward, given that our environment is in a particular <strong>state</strong> and thus what action to take.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/oh-hell/rlvisualisation.jpg"  alt="Main-Components-of-RL" title="Main Components of RL"></p><h2 id="Programming-the-Environment">Programming the Environment</h2><p>The first step was to implement a game of <i>Oh Hell</i> in Python. Most games studied under reinforcement learning follow a similar structure, and some build up to a class representing the environment the agent can train in. If your custom environment inherits from an existing base environment, you can use high level implementations of RL algorithms that require that base. For this project <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI’s gym</a> environment class was used. This base class has the abstract methods, step (take a single action) and reset (restart the environment). These methods are called by the final training algorithm.</p><p>The rules of <i>Oh Hell</i> use elements of <i>Poker</i> and <i>Uno</i> which have already been implemented countless times. The module <a href="https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RLCARD</a> by MIT has a set of already implemented environments for some card games, including <i>Poker</i> and <i>Uno</i>. Also the structure of RLCARD’s environments is very clean, so the base of this project used a lot of their methods. At the time of development, however, the environments in RLCARD were only for two-player games and did not have a PPO implementation (will cover more) so it had to be extended.</p><p>Below is the structure of the different classes in the code. Composition was used instead of inheritance; for instance, the Round class creates instances of players, a dealer, and a judger and their interaction is controlled within the Round class. A round in this code represents every player taking a single action, making a bid or playing a single card. A game represents the start of the bidding to the last card being played.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/LeLingu/OhHellProject/tree/main/rlohhell/games/ohhell" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/oh-hell/gamecode.jpg"  alt="Structure-of-code" title="Structure of Code"></a></p><h2 id="Extracting-the-input-state-from-the-environment">Extracting the input state from the environment</h2><p>Now, the agent needs to be able to ‘see’ the environment and then make predictions about what action to take. This process can be viewed as a function, so neural networks come in to try and approximate the function that gives the best predictions. If we encode the useful information in the game, the neural network should be able to draw out a strategy.</p><p>There are a few approaches to this particular section, one could encode almost everything in the environment and make it very easy for the neural network to pick out the optimal actions - or you could give the neural network only the basic information. The first method is a useful debugging tool since an agent with all the information about it’s environment should have no excuse not to learn. The latter method takes less time to program but would take longer to train and would not necessarily give the best model because some useful information could be neglected.</p><p>The encoding for the model at the time of this blog is below, and a detailed explanation of the <a href="https://github.com/LeLingu/OhHellProject/blob/main/rlohhell/envs/ohhell.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encodings</a> can be found on the github.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/oh-hell/currentencoding.jpg"  alt="Encoding"></p><h2 id="Opponents-for-the-agent-and-NFSP">Opponents for the agent and NFSP</h2><p>After extending the environment to a four-player game, what the agent would train against came into question. The approach that was taken in this project was inspired by the idea of <strong>Neural Fictitious Self-Play</strong> developed by David Silver and Johannes Heinrich, leading researchers in RL. At it’s core, the idea is to train the agent against itself. Initially, a basic model was trained against random agents, then a new model was trained against three versions of the last agent. The theory is to repeat this process each time until the new agent beats the old agents. Below is a snippet of the code from the environment that uses this idea:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="string">'''This section plays the game with the dummy agents until it is time for the training </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">agent to play then the agent's observation of the environment can be extracted'''</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">while</span> self.game.players[self.game.current_player].name != <span class="string">'Training'</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># The state is extracted from the current game</span></span><br><span class="line">    current_obs = self._extract_state(self.game.get_state(self.game.current_player))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># The observation is used in the trained model to predict an action</span></span><br><span class="line">    fictitious_action, _ = self.trained_model.predict(current_obs)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># The action is taken </span></span><br><span class="line">    _, _ = self.game.step(self._decode_action(fictitious_action))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># This section was used for training against random agents</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># a = random.choice(self.game.get_legal_actions())</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># _,_ = self.game.step(a)</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Choosing-an-RL-algorithm">Choosing an RL algorithm</h2><p>Coming back to the function we need to approximate, which is formally called the <strong>policy</strong>, there are a few different methods to choose from, however, they can all be categorised into two groups. Methods that generate training data (experience) from the same policy that is being evaluated are called <strong>on-policy</strong>. Methods that have two separate policies, one for generating experience and another for evaluation, are called <strong>off-policy</strong>.</p><p>The method we chose for this project was on-policy <strong>Proximal Policy Optimization</strong> or <strong>PPO</strong> by OpenAI. To quote their website directly, RL algorithms have a lot of ‘moving parts’ which makes the training of agents very unstable. PPO, however, uses a clipped objective function which reduces changes to the current policy so that the performance doesn’t suddenly decline whilst training. A detailed explanation of the objective function can be found <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 id="The-Neural-Network-Architecture">The Neural Network Architecture</h2><p>Adding on to our understanding of how to approximate the earlier function, PPO outputs the actions for the agent to take in the form of <strong>logits</strong> whilst it also outputs the <strong>state value</strong>. The logits are unnormalised predictions of the actions to take, the state value is the expected reward the agent will get from the current state if it follows the current policy. This additional evaluation of the state is why PPO is sometimes called an Actor-Critic algorithm.</p><p>With this in mind, shared layers in the <i>Oh Hell</i> agent meant the agent was unable to learn until the actor and critic were spilt into two different networks. The reason for this is not clear, but a common internal conflict that agents face in RL is choosing actions that maximize immediate reward vs long-term rewards or the crucial <strong>Exploration vs Exploitation Dilemma</strong>.</p><p>The structure of the neural network that generated the best model is below, with details of how many neurons where used at each level.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/oh-hell/neuralnetwork.jpg"  alt="Neural-network-architecture"></p><h2 id="Implementation-of-Algorithm">Implementation of Algorithm</h2><p>To run the PPO algorithm on the custom environment, the package <a href="https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stable-baselines3</a> was used. It has a PPO implementation that allows you to customise the layers on a neural network and offers tensorboard support so that you can visualise training results. The entire code that generates the neural network model is found <a href="https://github.com/LeLingu/OhHellProject/blob/main/custom_ppo/running_model.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> with explanations of what each section does.</p><p>Below are some of the metrics that were tracked by tensorboard during training.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/oh-hell/tensorboard.jpeg"  alt="Viewing-tensorboard-integration"></p><h2 id="Initial-Results">Initial Results</h2><p>The initial models struggled to correctly select which of the 63 actions were actually possible at any given point. In the game design, ineligible actions are replaced with a random action - so these initial models did not improve on what a random agent would have done.</p><p>At this stage, one could implement a so-called ‘mask’ over the unavailable actions which sets the logits of these actions to 0 or change the reward signal to the agent so that it is ‘punished’ everytime an unavailable action is selected. The latter approach is less coercive and is what was implemented. However, noticeably, it still leaves the agent with the ability to choose unavailable actions.</p><h2 id="Final-Results">Final Results</h2><p>The best trained model so far can not answer the original question of the best possible strategy for playing <em>Oh Hell</em>. The policy, however, shows a large improvement from a random agent; it will sometimes execute flawless runs, predicting a number of tricks, winning that number, and getting the extra bonus of 10 tricks and with no ineligible actions selected. This model will select an average of just under 2 unavailable actions per game which is a massive improvement from the original 10 out of 11.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/oh-hell/gameplay1.jpg"  alt="gameplay"></p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This project answered interesting questions of how RL agents are trained and this particular approach of using neural networks, Deep RL being only one of the methods in RL. If there was more time, a Monte Carlo Tree Search could hypothetically be implemented on top of this agent to improve it’s performance or a completely custom and more granular PPO implementation along with a mask.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Reinventing Test and Trace: A Bayesian Approach For Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Setting-Specific Transmission</title>
      <link href="/track-and-trace/"/>
      <url>/track-and-trace/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>It is no secret that the response of multiple countries following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been abismal - and the UK is no exception. With £355 billion amounting in economic losses (OBR, 2021), a 4.8% rate of unemployment (ONS, 2021) and, perhaps most shockingly, over 128,000 deaths to this date (<a href="http://Gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gov.uk</a>, 2021), the UK government has undoubtedly handled this crisis poorly, with two key government-led programmes standing out amongst the list of policy failures.</p><p>The Test and Trace programme, established to curb Coronavirus reproduction, aims to provide accessible testing as well as contact tracing to notify exposed individuals and instruct them to self-isolate. One major failure of the T&amp;T programme has been the lack of a coherent data collection strategy for analysing setting-specific transmission; that is, the relative likelihood of contracting COVID in different locations, such as a hair dresser, a restaurant, etc. Given the dependence of the UK Tier System on our understanding of setting-specific transmission, this alone serves as an explanation of the latter’s failure, as settings grouped together often bear no resemblance in terms of their underlying transmission rates, resulting in unnecessary business closures and contributing to the economic hemorrhage.</p><p>Thus, we set out to formulate a data collection and analysis methodology that is both compatible with the current T&amp;T programme and enables us to model and estimate setting-specific COVID-19 transmission rates, in the hope of guiding lockdown policies using a reliable, data-driven approach.</p><h2 id="Our-approach-and-assumptions">Our approach and assumptions</h2><h3 id="Data-collection-methodology">Data collection methodology</h3><p>Starting out, our goal was to model a random vector <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold-italic">θ</mi><mo>∈</mo><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mi>P</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\boldsymbol{\theta} \in [0,1]^P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.73354em;vertical-align:-.0391em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord boldsymbol" style="margin-right:.03194em">θ</span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span><span class="mrel">∈</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.0913309999999998em;vertical-align:-.25em"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.16666666666666666em"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose"><span class="mclose">]</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:.8413309999999999em"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:.05em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:.13889em">P</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> of transmission rates for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.68333em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.13889em">P</span></span></span></span> different settings. To estimate this model, we would require data that could be feasibly collected through the T&amp;T programme. Therefore, we devised the following data collection strategy to accompany the probabilistic model developed below, making sure to prioritize its feasibility and scalability:</p><ol><li><p>Data is to be collected from individuals in the T&amp;T programme through a short survey of binary responses on whether or not they visited each one of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.68333em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.13889em">P</span></span></span></span> locations in the last few days.</p></li><li><p>For each individual surveyed through T&amp;T, the result of their COVID-19 antigen test is also observed.</p></li><li><p>Finally, a random survey is also sent out. This survey is identical to the one in (1.) but, since it is not distributed by T&amp;T, no antigen test is taken and therefore no outcome is observed.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Model-assumptions">Model assumptions</h3><p>In order for us to combine this data collection methodology with a statistical model that allows for inference on the estimated setting-specific transmission rates, we had to lay down the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>Multiple visits to a location in one week are rare enough to be ignored or in cases (such as supermarkets) where multiple visits are expected, the distribution of number of visits is tight.</li></ul><h2 id="Building-a-first-principles-model">Building a first-principles model</h2><p>Given the data collection strategy detailed above, for each

id="Our-model-in-Stan">Our model in Stan</h3><p>We implemented the code for our first-principles model using Stan, a probabilistic inference language compiled in C++. Stan allows users to carry out full Bayesian inference on statistical models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and enables model specification in a block-like fashion. The main building blocks for our Stan model are:</p><ol><li>The data block, which specifies the type and dimensions of data used to train the model.</li><li>The parameter block, which specifies all underlying statistical parameters of the model.</li><li>The model block, which assigns parameter priors and constructs the model likelihood describing the joint probability of the observed data as a function of the parameters.</li></ol><p>With computational feasibility in mind, we also coded a version of our model using the TensorFlow Probability framework, as this version supports the use of GPU’s and distributed computing capabilities to deliver greater computational power.

To overcome this, Stan utilizes the NUTS algorithm (part of the general class of MCMC methods) to infer the posterior distribution by repeatedly drawing samples from it, even though its full closed-form characterization is unknown. Unlike regular Monte Carlo sampling, which draws independent samples, MCMC allows for ‘smarter’ sampling as it draws correlated samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain that’s proportional to the desired distribution. This allows for the sampling process to enter regions of high density much faster. For more details regarding how Stan achieves this using the NUTS algorithm, the interested reader should refer to <a href="https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_18/reference-manual/hmc-chapter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link.</a></p><p>At its core, there are three hyperparamters that need to be specified for MCMC sampling with the NUTS algorithm.<br>Firstly, the <code>num_warmup</code> parameter is used to specify the number of samples that are discarded as burn-in. This is done in order to allow convergence onto the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. Secondly, the <code>n_samples</code> parameter specifies the number of samples to be drawn from the distribution. Finally, <code>n_chains</code> specifies the number of chains that should be constructed, as using more well-mixed chains increases robustness.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">### MCMC SAMPLING HYPERPARAMETERS ####</span></span><br><span class="line">ITER = <span class="number">1000</span></span><br><span class="line">WARMUP = <span class="number">500</span></span><br><span class="line">CHAINS = <span class="number">8</span></span><br><span class="line">SEED = <span class="number">1729</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#### MODEL FITTING ####</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Define model data</span></span><br><span class="line">model_data = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">'T'</span>: T, <span class="string">'S'</span>: S, <span class="string">'P'</span>: sum(P), <span class="string">'K'</span>: len(P),</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">'X'</span>: X.to_numpy(), <span class="string">'y'</span>: y.to_numpy(), <span class="string">'c'</span>: c, <span class="string">'m'</span>: m, <span class="string">'m_survey'</span>: m_survey,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">'survey'</span>: X_survey.to_numpy(), <span class="string">'lambda_prior_params'</span>:prior_params,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Compile model</span></span><br><span class="line">posterior = stan.build(model_code, data=model_data, random_seed=<span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Fit model</span></span><br><span class="line">fit = posterior.sample(num_samples=ITER, num_warmup=WARMUP, num_chains=CHAINS)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Results-and-conclusion">Results and conclusion</h2><h3 id="Visualizing-posterior-samples">Visualizing posterior samples</h3><p>After running our model, we computed the summary statistics of our posterior samples in the table below.

question is the extent to which our model is successful in estimating the underlying transmission rates. To test this, we take the posterior mean as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimum mean squared error estimate</a> and compare it to the ground-truth parameters used to simulate the data-generating process. As shown in the table below, most parameter estimates fall reasonably close from the actual ground truth values, and all of them fall within the 94% high density interval (HDI), serving as a good indicator of our model’s accuracy.</p><p>The key condition for this comparison as proof-of-concept is the fact that our model only observes the parameter priors and the training data, but never the simulating distributions themselves. Moreover, excluding the case of antigen test accuracy rates, the priors as specifically chosen to be largely uninformative relative to the simulating distribution in order to limit the unreasonable influence of these on model performance.</p><p>Finally, a question of interest is how the accuracy of the model is affected by the number of training samples or the dimension of the parameter space. The results for both of these questions are excluded for brevity, but they tend to fall in line with what would be expected (model accuracy increases with training data and decreases with

id="Conclusion-and-future-work">Conclusion and future work</h3><p>This project aimed to understand &amp; model the nature of setting-specific COVID transmission with the purpose of informing and improving related policy interventions. The first-principles model presented in this article allows us to do this in a way that properly captures the data-generating process behind setting-specific transmission, all with considerations of a simple and feasible data collection methodology. Furthermore, the Bayesian nature of our model allows flexibility when incorporating expert knowledge through priors, as exemplified with the calibrated antigen test accuracy parameters, and provides accurate estimates even with few training samples thanks to its generative nature. Finally, from an implementation perspective, our model is built with scalability in mind, as the TensorFlow Probability version makes it feasible for large-scale applications with the aid of distributed computing architecture.</p><p>There is still much left to be done and many possible extensions could be added to make our model more robust and powerful. One possible angle for future work would be extending the model to encapsulate the effect of other policy interventions (such as social distancing regulations, vaccination, etc.) in order to derive insights about the effectiveness of these in different settings. Another possible extension could be to add temporal dynamics into the model by combining with an SIR-type model.</p><p>Overall, we believe this model serves as a great case for statistical modeling of setting-specific epidemic transmission, with great potential for future extensions and applications to similar settings. Additionally, it serves as a great example of the power of Bayesian modelling and the many benefits it can bring in applied settings.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Predicting aqueous solubility with neural networks</title>
      <link href="/chemical-properties/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Aqueous solubility is a key physical property of interest in the medicinal and agrochemical industry. Low aqueous solubility of compounds can be a major problem in drug development, as <a href="https://biomedpharmajournal.org/vol13no2/the-importance-of-solubility-for-new-drug-molecules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 40% of newly developed chemicals are practically insoluble in water.</a> For a drug to be absorbed it needs to be contained in a solution at the site of the absorption and solubility is the main parameter that influences the bioavailability of a molecule. Many drug manufacturers are inclined more to produce oral drug products due to their ease of administration, lack of sterility constraints and high patient compliance, which causes them to prioritise bioavailability and therefore aqueous solubility.</p><p>As designing and approving a new drug is an expensive, nearly decade-long process, new methods for the prediction of a compound’s aqueous solubility prior to its synthesis could greatly facilitate the process of drug development. Aqueous solubility is also a major factor in the development of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides as highly soluble substances <a href="https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/PI202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are more likely to move through the soil in water than less-soluble substances</a>, therefore they are able to reach the plants and take effect more easily. This suggests that the agrochemical industry can also greatly benefit from new methods of estimating aqueous solubility of compounds without the presence of a physical sample.</p><p>Machine learning is a branch of computer science that focuses on the use of algorithms and data to imitate the way that humans learn. It allows us to create models that can predict a compound’s aqueous solubility straight from its molecular structure without the presence of a physical sample. Not having to run sophisticated and computationally expensive physical simulations can greatly reduce the amount of time and funds spent in the process of drug discovery.</p><p>Machine learning algorithms can be grouped into regressive algorithms used to predict a continious value (age, salary, etc.) and classification algorithms used to predict discrete values (male, female, etc.). Predicting a compound’s aqueous solubility is a regression problem rather than a classification one and the model can be taught to predict a value based on a set of inputs in a process called supervised learning.</p><h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2><p>The entire project was completed using Python. We used the dataset ESOL, containing the solubilities of 1144 chemical compounds and their structures in the SMILES format. SMILES is a commonly used notation used for describing the structure of chemical compounds with short ASCII strings. The compounds contained in the dataset are mostly pesticide products, low molecular weight organic compounds, and heavy compounds.</p><p>The library <code>rdkit</code> was used to extract features from the dataset. It provides methods to calculate:</p><ul><li><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">logP</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-.19444em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.01968em">l</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.03588em">g</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.13889em">P</span></span></span></span> - partition coefficient;

Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the <strong>linear</strong> relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. Data was split into training and testing datasets with 80% of the data used for training the model. Metrics we used to quantify how well a model fits the dataset were <em>RMSE</em> and <em>R-Squared</em>.</p><div class="note info"><ul><li><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math

They are collections of nodes called artificial neurons, which are models that imitate neurons in real brains. In contrast to linear regression, neural networks can model more complex, non-linear relationships between predictive variables and the response variable without assuming that a fixed equation can fit the model.</p><p>A neural network model was created using <code>keras</code> and <code>tensorflow</code>. To build a neural network we first need to investigate the following features: vectors, layers and linear regression. Our data source has been stored in vectors and with the help of python can be converted into multidimensional arrays. These arrays are then used to calculate the dot product, which tells us how similar the data is in terms of direction. Weights and bias vectors are the main type of vectors present inside a neural network; these are used to predict outputs by comparing input data to previously seen inputs. Layers have been added to the neural network to extract representations found in the previous data, hidden layers are also present to take a set of weighted inputs and produce an output through an activation function. Linear regression can be thought of as a neural network consisting of just one layer, as every input is connected to every output. This layer can be seen as fully connected and can be used within the neural network.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

The models can be compared using this graph, showing the distribution of measured molecule solubility and predicted molecule solubility of both models.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/chemical-properties/models_comparison.png"  alt="comparison"></p><p>As our problem is classed as regression, we needed to replace the categorical variables within the neural network to numeric dependent variables. Otherwise, the model would try categorise outputs. There are several limitations to using neural networks on regression problems which are mainly related to the data source properties and their optimalisation, these include:</p><ul><li>Dataset size – how many training examples are present</li><li>Data dimension</li><li>Data structure - structured/ unstructured</li></ul><p>To stabilise the model, a large dataset is required. Our dataset is well structure however, it is relatively small with only a 1000 plus records. Combining our dataset with other solubility data would increase the number of inputs and therefore improve the models ability to predict. As a further develop we could also investigate different validation methods such as cross validation, as our method reduced the size of the training dataset as holdout validation was used. Our models results proved more useful than those of the linear regression model; yet, improvements could still be made for better performance and other machine learning models should be investigated. This includes researching gradient boosted decision trees, which are said to work well in similar regression problems.</p><h2 id="Conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>Molecular machine learning methods for the prediction of chemical properties can have far-reaching benefits for industries relating to chemistry. They could greatly reduce the cost and time used in the process of drug development. Methods similar to ours can also be used to predict other chemical properties like lipophilicity or solvation free energy.<br>While the accuracy of these methods may not always be perfect, they can still prove to be useful by giving researchers suggestions about whether the compounds they’re researching fit their criteria. Until sophisticated and reliable molecular learning methods are widely recognised we can’t greatly depend on them in research, however they can still serve as advisory tools. Conducting synthesis and running sophisticated tests isn’t always the most viable option, therefore these methods can prove to be useful where time and budget is limited.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>This post is the corresponding write-up for a WDSS project in which a pair of students in Statistics collaborated to produce a web app for testing user’s ability to simulate a believable sequence of independent Bernoulli events akin to a series of coin flips. You can view the final product at <a href="https://app.wdss.io/random-coin-flips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</p></div><h2 id="Project-Motivation">Project Motivation</h2><p>Random events happen without an underlying pattern, meaning no consistent algorithm can produce a series of truly random events.<br>After numerous psychological tests, scientists found that people often approach the concept of randomness with underlying assumptions about its nature - usually ones that contradict its definition.<br>Humans have an inherent tendency to look for predictability in anything they encounter to improve their understanding of it.<br>Unfortunately, this instinct often leads to a paradox where one attempts to make sense of randomness as something predictable, worsening their understanding of it instead.</p><p>With the development of statistical mathematics, we can “measure” the randomness of events with appropriate hypothesis testing methods.<br>The motivation behind this project is to create a program that, with the help of hypothesis testing theory, grades a user’s ability to create plausible random sequences.<br>This project is interested only in measuring randomness in human-generated binary sequences.</p><h1>Preliminaries</h1><p>There is not yet an official way to measure randomness, however, there are statistical tests that, when combined, accomplish such a function to a reasonable degree.<br>The project utilises seven tests deemed to be useful enough for detecting implausible random sequences.<br>We will justify the usage of the seven tests before explaining how to carry them out. First, let’s start with explaining the basics.</p><div class="note info"><p>A <strong>binary sequence</strong> is an ordered string consisting of two different symbols only.<br>Commonly, computers express binary sequences using the symbols <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong>.<br>An example of such a binary sequence is <strong>100011</strong> and has a length of six because it consists of six symbols.<br>Numeric sequences, in general, possess a wide range of characteristics expressible as values; binary sequences are no exception.</p></div><p>Numerical properties of binary sequences that can be measured include:</p><ul><li>The length of the sequence</li><li>The number of <strong>0</strong>s and <strong>1</strong>s</li><li>The proportion of <strong>0</strong>s or <strong>1</strong>s to the length of the sequence</li><li>The longest run of one symbol (the second-longest, third, etc.)</li><li>The number of runs</li><li>The number of runs of a specified length</li><li>etc. …</li></ul><p>These measures can be used to determine how close a human-generated binary sequence is to a truly <em>random</em> binary sequence. Whenever we are dealing with uncertainity about the truth value of a given statement, statisticians will turn to <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>. People cannot fully validate a hypothesis about the properties of an unknown quantity of interest (e.g. mean incomes of a household in the UK, the variation of exam marks at Warwick) without analysing all members of the population related to the variate, which is often impossible. Therefore statisticians use samples, a limited number of members from the population, to yield partial evidence for the properties of a variate.</p><div class="note info"><p>A <strong>hypothesis test</strong> is a tool for producing partial evidence for a hypothesis from samples, the performance of which depends on the amount of information available for testing and the nature of the test.</p></div><p>A hypothesis test often conveniently gives evidence as a <strong>p-value</strong>, commonly defined as the probability that a variate abiding by its hypothesised properties produced a given sample. The smaller the probability that the hypothesised variate could have produced the sample, the smaller the p-value. By this logic, a p-value of a test can serve as a measure of how closely a series of Bernoulli events can resemble a given binary sequence.</p><div class="note success"><p>The level of statistical significance is often expressed as a <strong>p-value</strong> between 0 and 1. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.</p></div><p>More information on hypothesis testing and statistical inference can be found in H. Liero, S. Zwanzig (2011), <em>Introduction to the Theory of Statistical Inference</em> and G. Casella, R. L. Berger (2002), <em>Statistical Inference, Second Edition</em></p><h1>Overiview of the tests</h1><p>This section explains what the properties and rationale are behind the seven apps implemented in the Shiny R app. For more mathematically involved derivations of each of these tests, refer to <a href="#the-theory">the Theory section</a>.</p><p>The statistical tests used in this project include:</p><ul><li>The Bernoulli Distribution Test</li><li>The Generalised Runs Test</li><li>The Longest Run Length Test</li><li>The Hadamard-Walsh Test</li><li>The Multinomial Test</li><li>The Last Equalisation Test</li></ul><p>There exist time-series methods for measuring the predictability of a sequence, of which none were used in the project due to time constraints and limited intellectual resources.<br>The rest of this document will explain the theory behind each test and the program’s design.</p><h2 id="Bernoulli-Distribution-Test">Bernoulli Distribution Test</h2><p>The standard Bernoulli Distribution Test tests the plausibility that a series of identical, independent Bernoulli events can produce a given binary sequence.<br>A Bernoulli event is essentially a coin toss with a set bias towards a specified side of the coin.<br>Based on this interpretation of a Bernoulli event, the Bernoulli Distribution Test is highly appropriate for the project’s purpose.<br>The test uses the proportion of <strong>1</strong>s to the sequence length as its only input, which carries no information about the arrangement of the sequence.</p><p>Thus, a sample with a <strong>1</strong>s to length ratio that strongly deviates from the hypothesised proportion would result in a small p-value upon applying the Bernoulli Distribution Test.<br>It is necessary to utilise a different set of tests altogether to consider the arrangement of entries in a given sequence.</p><h2 id="Generalised-Runs-Test">Generalised Runs Test</h2><p>The Generalised Runs Test is a hypothesis test inspired by the non-parametric Wald-Wolfowitz Runs Test.<br>The Wald-Wolfowitz Runs Test tests the serial independence of entries in a binary sequence of a given length using the number of runs in the series as an input.<br>Unlike the Wald-Wolfowitz Test, the Generalised Runs Test does not assume that samples come from a finite population and does not assume that the two outcomes are equally likely.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike the Bernoulli Distribution Test, the Generalised Runs Test has an underdeveloped theory.<br>Statisticians do not yet know the limiting distribution of runs in a Bernoulli trial sequence.<br>Regardless, the test considers the arrangement of <strong>1</strong>s and <strong>0</strong>s in the series, which the Bernoulli Distribution Test does not.</p><p>A sequence with one run is a repetition of one symbol. In contrast, a sequence with maximal runs is a periodic sequence of isolated <strong>1</strong>s and <strong>0</strong>s.<br>The two possibilities mentioned strongly express patterned behaviour, meaning they are weak contenders for being random sequences.<br>Therefore, the number of runs in a sequence should be between one and the sequence length to plausibly represent a series of independent Bernoulli events.</p><h2 id="Longest-Run-Length-Test">Longest Run Length Test</h2><p>Similar to the Generalised Runs Test, the Longest Run Test is underdeveloped but less so.<br>The test uses the length of the longest run in a binary series as its input.<br>This test also considers the arrangement of <strong>1</strong>s and <strong>0</strong>s in the sequence, though differently this time.</p><p>A sequence whose maximum run length is one is a periodic sequence of isolated <strong>1</strong>s and <strong>0</strong>s.<br>Alternatively, a sequence with a maximum run as long as the series consists of only one symbol.<br>Again both possibilities are weak contenders for being random sequences for being too patterned.<br>So, the longest run in a sequence should fall between the two extreme cases to plausibly represent a series of independent Bernoulli events.</p><h2 id="Hadamard-Walsh-Test">Hadamard-Walsh Test</h2><p>Similar to how one can decompose functions with continuous domains into a sum of sine and cosine waves with a Fourier transform, one can decompose binary sequences into sums of Walsh functions with a Hadamard-Walsh transform.<br>A Walsh function is a periodic square wave function that takes one and negative one as its values.<br>One can decompose any binary sequence into Walsh functions because they constitute a complete set of orthogonal discrete functions.</p><p>The transform yields a vector that numerically indicates how strongly a given binary sequence resembles each Walsh function.<br>The disadvantage of the Hadamard-Walsh transform is it works only with vectors of lengths equal to powers of two, so the project will work only with binary sequences of lengths 32 and 64 to account for the limitation.</p><p>Theoretically, a random sequence is more likely to resemble every Walsh function weakly.<br>The more a sequence resembles a single Walsh function, the more patterned it is.</p><h2 id="Multinomial-Test">Multinomial Test</h2><p>The natural extension to the Bernoulli Distribution Test is looking at pairs of tosses.<br>For <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math

last time in which the number of heads will equal the number of tails.<br>We can then use our binary input to find the last equalisation in our observed sequence.</p><p>We define an equalisation in our binary sequence as the time step in which the number of <strong>1</strong>s and <strong>0</strong>s are equal.<br>With this distribution and observed statistic, we can calculate the associated p-value of the observed value.</p><h1>App Design</h1><p>All tests mentioned above are incorporated into a single R Shiny app that automatically calculates the required p-values and statistics from an

has the incorrect length, the program will inform the user about the current length of the input string so the user will know how many terms to add or subtract.</p><p>The <code>Input Coin Bias</code> slider allows the user to set the bias of the Bernoulli distribution fitted to the input sample.<br>The program will not compute the p-values if the set bias is an integer; the program will warn the

the Bernoulli distribution is to the input sequence.<br>The closer the red line on the plot is to the black line, the smaller the Walsh-Hadamard test metric is, and the more random the input sequence is.</p><p>The app also offers a small guide in the right-hand corner of the screen.</p><h1>The Theory</h1><h2 id="Bernoulli-Distribution-Test-Theory">Bernoulli Distribution Test Theory</h2><p>The

32.<br>The excess processing stems from the calculation of the CDFs of the max run test, requiring a large number of computations to complete.<br>One can reduce the program computation time by

      <title>Computational Approach to Evolutionary Game Theory</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is a field of game theory that originated from a formalisation of ideas outlined by population geneticist Ronald Fisher in 1930. The theory predicts that the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1, meaning the same number of male and female offspring are produced. The reasoning behind this being that if there were an excess of a certain sex, the genes that predispose a member of the species to have more offspring of the other sex would have more surviving offspring, thus shifting the genes towards the 1:1 ratio.</p><p>The most important concept in microeconomics is that of equilibrium, and this is no different in game theory. Equilibrium concepts in traditional game theory include Nash equilibria (NE) and dominating strategy, however as games become more complex through the repetition of gameplay, these “one-shot” solutions no longer fully capture or explain the behaviour of the players. For this reason, the 1973 article by John Maynard Smith and George R. Price “Game theory and evolution” which formalised Fisher’s ideas into solution concepts is celebrated as the birth of a new type of game theory.</p><p>However, EGT is not just for studying populations of living creatures. In the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the theory of EGT contributes insights into learning in multi-agent systems (MAS) and helps researchers develop improved learning algorithms.</p><p>MAS is closely related to agent-based modelling (ABM), which looks for emergent behaviours in complex systems through simulating interactions of autonomous individuals. It looks for how micro-scale changes to individuals can have macro-scale effects on the overarching system.</p><p>In this article, we will introduce a problem in population dynamics containing three different species of bird each with a unique behaviour. We will study the problem from two different perspectives, EGT and ABM, and aim to answer two questions:</p><ol><li><p>For any given setup, is there a species that drives out all the others?</p></li><li><p>Are there any stable points where the ratio of the three species gravitate towards 1:1 from the offspring sex ratio example?</p></li></ol><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/evolutionary-game-theory/equilibrium.jpg"  alt="Equilibrium"></p><h2 id="The-Situation">The Situation</h2><p>In his 1976 book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, one of the situations Dawkins describes is how certain birds have evolved the strategy of sneaking their eggs into other birds’ nests so they don’t have to expend the energy in look after the offspring themselves. Cuckoos, sometimes referred to as Brood Parasites, are an example of birds that use this strategy.</p><p>One potential problem for our parasitic cuckoos, however, is that certain species of birds have evolved to be able to identify their own eggs. This means that a cuckoo unfortunate enough to lay their egg in one of these nests would not get any benefit from doing so. Guillemots are birds who can identify their own eggs, on the other hand this identification process may take a while and use energy that could otherwise be used on finding food. Finally, some species such as chickens have such a strong ingrained sense of looking after whatever is in their nest that they will sit on anything that falls into it, including fake eggs and even small animals such as kittens. Anything in their nest they treat as their own. In their naturally evolved habitat, there would be no brood parasites, so identifying one’s own eggs would not have been a particularly useful trait.</p><p>Now in a game theory setting, we assign payoffs to outcomes. We assume that sitting on an egg always causes it to hatch a chick. For every egg that hatches, the bird who laid the egg will get <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.69444em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span></span></span></span> points. For every egg that the bird has to sit on, the bird will lose <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span></span></span></span> points.

For the sake of clarity, the phrase “population state” will be used to refer to the number of each type of bird within the total population.</p><p>There are two types of equilibrium that we are interested in.<br>The first is the Nash equilibrium. In this context, a Nash equilibrium is a certain population state in which no type would want to change the actions that they take. Hence, in order to have a Nash equilibrium, the utility of each type of bird in a population must be equal and, if any types of birds are not in this population, the utility of these types, if they were to be introduced, must not be greater than the utility of the birds that are in the population. The second type of equilibrium is the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). An ESS is a certain population state in which no type of bird would benefit from a small change in the state.</p><p>In order to find these equilibria, there are two viewpoints that need to be considered.<br>The first is the most intuitive: we consider each member of the population as an individual who will act in a certain way according to their type.<br>The second is less intuitive, but often more helpful when it comes to calculations: we consider an ‘average’ member of the population who can take any of the actions available to the population types and will take any particular action with a certain probability. In particular, it will take a certain type’s action with probability equal to the proportion of that type in the population.<br>These viewpoints are equivalent. Suppose you have a population of three types: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.68333em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span>, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.68333em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.05017em">B</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.68333em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.07153em">C</span></span></span></span>.

Likewise, if there are 15 members of type A, 10 of type B and 5 of type C, this is equivalent to an ‘average’ player who takes A’s, B’s and C’s actions with probabilities ½, ⅓ and ⅙ respectively. The second viewpoint allows us to formally define a Nash equilibrium and an ESS.</p><div class="note info"><p>The derivation of the equilibria will be completed in the appendix.</p></div><p>Suppose that we have a total population size of T.

However, this is not an ESS. For those curious as to why this will be demonstrated in the appendix, but we can also gain insight about this by using simulation.</p><h2 id="Agent-Based-Modelling-Simulated-Approach">Agent Based Modelling (Simulated) Approach</h2><p>As discussed earlier, the aim of ABM is to model the micro to observe the macro. Those from an Economics background may already have alarm bells ringing in their head as microeconomics and macroeconomics are treated fundamentally differently and often do not cross paths. Indeed, much criticism has been raised to agent-based models used in the social sciences due to the complexity of human behaviour and the black-box nature of agent-based methods. In this situation however, our agents are predisposed to act in a certain way due to their genes. Of course, in real life there will be idiosyncrasies in the behaviour of each individual animal, but the goal of this model is to see effects on a species level, rather than an individual level, so each agent is modelled to be identical to others in its species.</p><p>Our agent-based model is written using the Julia package, <code>Agents</code>, which allows the user to focus on what is important to their own model rather than having to write an entire model from scratch. We provide the package with the types of our agents, their attributes, how they act, what order they act in, how they reproduce, and how they are affected by their environments (if relevant).</p><p>As much of the code is repeated, we’ll look at the implementation of one of our custom types so you can get a feel for how <code>Agents</code> works:</p><figure class="highlight julia"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">mutable struct</span> Cheater &lt;: AbstractAgent</span><br><span class="line">    id::<span class="built_in">Int</span></span><br><span class="line">    eggs_laid::<span class="built_in">Int</span>  <span class="comment"># how many eggs the agent lays</span></span><br><span class="line">    egg_ids::<span class="built_in">Dict</span>  <span class="comment"># how many eggs placed in this nest by each id</span></span><br><span class="line">    utility::<span class="built_in">Float64</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">end</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>A few technical things to note:</p><ol><li>A <code>mutable struct</code> is what Julia calls a class from Python.</li><li>We specify in the definition that <code>Cheater</code> is a subtype of <code>AbstractAgent</code> which lets <code>Agents</code> assume everything applying to an arbitrary agent will also apply to our <code>Cheater</code> type.</li><li>Our struct must contain an <code>id</code>, this is our only way to tell agents of the same type apart.</li></ol><p>Now we can define how our agent will behave when it is called upon to move.

In our case, this will be to tally up the utility of each type and construct a new population such that the proportion of each type is equal to that type’s share of the total utility in the previous step. We also want to define some sort of population mutation which can introduce an element of randomness into the model. This is to see if we can confirm the analytic solution by making the setup as similar as possible.</p><figure class="highlight julia"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br><span class="line">43</span><br><span class="line">44</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br><span class="line">46</span><br><span class="line">47</span><br><span class="line">48</span><br><span class="line">49</span><br><span class="line">50</span><br><span class="line">51</span><br><span class="line">52</span><br><span class="line">53</span><br><span class="line">54</span><br><span class="line">55</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">function</span> model_step!(model)</span><br><span class="line">    nonextinct_types = unique(typeof.(allagents(model)))</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Aggregate all egg_ids of non-extinct types into an array of IDs </span></span><br><span class="line">    nest_id_array = [</span><br><span class="line">        id <span class="keyword">for</span> (id, agent) <span class="keyword">in</span> model.agents</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> typeof(agent) <span class="keyword">in</span> intersect([Sitter, Identifier],nonextinct_types)</span><br><span class="line">    ]</span><br><span class="line">    hatched_egg_dict = <span class="built_in">Dict</span>&#123;<span class="built_in">Int64</span>,<span class="built_in">Int64</span>&#125;()</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> nest_id <span class="keyword">in</span> nest_id_array</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">for</span> (egg_id, tally) <span class="keyword">in</span> model.agents[nest_id].egg_ids</span><br><span class="line">            increment_dict!(hatched_egg_dict, egg_id, tally)</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">end</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">end</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Calculate utility of each agent and then type</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> (key, agent) <span class="keyword">in</span> model.agents</span><br><span class="line">        agent.utility = model.hatch_utility * get(hatched_egg_dict, key, <span class="number">0</span>) +</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="built_in">Int</span>(!<span class="keyword">isa</span>(agent, Cheater)) * -model.egg_cost * get(agent.egg_ids, key, <span class="number">0</span>) +</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="built_in">Int</span>(<span class="keyword">isa</span>(agent, Identifier)) * -model.identify_cost</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">end</span></span><br><span class="line">    utilities = map(agent_type -&gt;

Our animated example shows that even if we start in the centre we are pushed out to the extrema. We can visualise this movement in a vector field plot, also known as a quiver plot. Here the plot is constructed by initialising the model with a certain number of agents, running it for one step (i.e. letting all agents move once), and then seeing where the model ends up. If we average this out over 100s of runs we can come to a pretty accurate approximation for the true value. Constructing a plot like this could be possible analytically, but requires knowledge of differential equations to get a similar level of accuracy that can be obtained through simulation.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/evolutionary-game-theory/evolutionary-game-theory_17_0.svg"  alt=""></p><p>Using this quiver plot we can see that our NSS from before is clearly not going to be evolutionarily stable, as there are arrows all around it forcing the population state away from the point.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/evolutionary-game-theory/evolutionary-game-theory_20_0.svg"  alt=""></p><h2 id="Discussion">Discussion</h2><p>Traditional analytic methods give precise general solutions. These solutions can be particularly useful when you’re looking to induce a certain behaviour or state in a given system, as they can tell you what the input parameters should be to ensure you end up at the state you want. However, these methods are limited in scope. An obvious limitation is that there is no concept of the environment in which the agents live, so you can’t model things like distance travelled without making special considerations. You can extend analytic methods by looking at evolutionary graph theory, which considers how topology affects a population, but these extensions themselves can become intractable and may not have closed form solutions.</p><p>Agent-based models produce simulations and one can make inferences from their outcomes about the nature of the system. While these insights may not be as precise as the analytic solutions and can require a lot of computing power, it is possible to add so much more to a model than you can with analytic solutions before they become really hard to solve. For example, in our model we could have looked at what happens if certain species are allowed to lay more than 1 egg, or we could program in that nests with fewer eggs gain more utility for the eggs’ owners, or indeed we could add in a space for the agents to live.</p><h2 id="Appendix">Appendix</h2><p>We start by considering the payoffs:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Strategy</th><th>Cost/Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Having your own egg hatch</td><td>h</td></tr><tr><td>Sitting on eggs</td><td>-e (per egg)</td></tr><tr><td>Identifying eggs</td><td>-i</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we are assuming <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>e</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h,e,i &gt;0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-.19444em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.16666666666666666em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.16666666666666666em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span><span class="mrel">&gt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.64444em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h-e-i&gt;0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.77777em;vertical-align:-.08333em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">h</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2222222222222222em"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2222222222222222em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.66666em;vertical-align:-.08333em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2222222222222222em"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2222222222222222em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.69862em;vertical-align:-.0391em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span><span class="mrel">&gt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.64444em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span></p><p>From these we can obtain the utilities for each type of bird.

      <title>Visualising the Intersection of Disease and the Human Genome</title>
      <link href="/genome-visualisation/"/>
      <url>/genome-visualisation/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note success"><p><strong>Try it for Yourself</strong><br>This article is the write-up for an interactive web application, allowing you to visualise CpG islands and SnP sites for different diseases. You can acces the app <a href="https://cloud.wdss.io/genome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to test it on diseases of your choosing.</p></div><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Beginning in the early '90s, the Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international research collaboration that attempted to sequence and map all of the genes for Homo sapiens. The HGP was completed in 2003 and paved way for significant developments to be made in drug discovery.</p><p>In 2000, the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and collaborators of the HGP started work on creating a free public access human genome assembly. To this day, it remains open access and has many features which can be used to relate information from the human genome to disease.</p><p>It was found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SnPs) and CpG islands are commonly located around diseases. An SnP is the most common type of genetic variation between people. They occur, on average, once in every 1000 nucleotides (roughly 4 million SnPs in total). As an example, an SnP may replace the nucleotide cytosine © with the nucleotide thymine (T) in a certain stretch of DNA. CpG islands are important because they represent areas of the genome that have, for some reason, been protected from the mutating properties of methylation through evolutionary time (which tends to change the G in CpG pairs to an A). Often, they point to the presence of an important piece of intergenic DNA, such as that found in the promoter regions of genes where transcription factors bind. In cancers, loss of expression of genes occurs about 10 times more frequently by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands than by mutations.</p><h2 id="Building-a-Visualisation">Building a Visualisation</h2><p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) contains information on where many diseases can be found within the human genome. These positions were collated onto a spreadsheet, along with a link to more information on the relevant disease.<br><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/genome-visualisation/diseases_spreadsheet.png"  alt="Spreadsheet of Diseases"><br>From the locations of the diseases obtained from the NCBI, information on SnP sites and CpG islands was collected using the API on the UCSC genome browser using the SnP and CpG island tracks.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/genome-visualisation/UCSC_genome_browser.png"  alt="UCSC Genome Browser"></p><p>GViz, a Bioconductor package for R, was used to then display the genome location, producing a visual representation graphically of the SnP sites and CpG islands.<br><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/genome-visualisation/disease_visualisation.png"  alt="Visualisation of Disease"><br>The lines on the SnP track show sites that have a minor allele frequency of at least 1% and are mapped to a single location in the reference genome assembly. The highlighted areas on the CpG island are where there is a GC content of higher than 50% for greater than 200bp. The red line on the chromosome highlights the area in which the disease is located, and what is able to be viewed on the tracks is data within the highlighted region.</p><p>One significant challenge faced was that, due to the vast amount of data needed to produce the genome plots, once a disease had been selected, it took a considerable amount of time for the API to collect the data. This meant it was less than ideal due to users not wanting to wait a lengthy period of time. The way this was overcome was by pre-generating the plots for each disease in the spread sheet, meaning that the plots were shown instantaneously.</p><p>Future improvements to the programme could include but not limited to caching the data collected rather than having pre-generated plots. This would work well with another improvement which was considered whereby the disease spreadsheet was connected to the NCBI database which contained every single disease known with the possibility of more disease identification as well. This would mean the programme could keep up-to date with new diseases entering the database and would not need manually updating.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Simulating Planetary Motion with Python</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p><strong>Accessing Post Source</strong><br>We are still working on getting this site set up, so source code for this post is not yet available. Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>As the 19th Century drew to a close, King Oscar II of Sweden set out a challenge. The problem was to find a general solution to what is known as the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-body problem.</p><p>This problem was mathematical in nature, asking how a system of planetary bodies would evolve with time according to Newton’s laws of gravitation and motion. That is, can you predict where a planet will be in the future with precision using physics alone?</p><p>The problem sounds simple enough. With a complete understanding of the laws of motion that planets obey, it was just a matter of extrapolating forwards in time. As such, it wasn’t long before a proof, by the esteemed mathematician Henri Poincaré, was published.</p><p>Sadly, it wasn’t much longer after that before a fatal mistake in his proof was found. And the heartbreak doesn’t end there; it was soon discovered that the problem was in fact unsolvable for non-trivial cases. That is, although there were special cases where a solution exists, a general solution was proved non-existent.</p><div class="note success"><p>Although this tale has a rather disappointing conclusion, it is worth noting that this problem was a great inspiration for the invention of the mathemical field of chaos theory, devoted to understanding and analysing <em>chaotic</em> systems such as <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-body planetary motion.</p></div><p>If no closed-form solution exists for these problems, how can we make predictions about planetary motion? How do we know that in a few years’ time there won’t be an apocalyptic collision between the Earth and another member of the solar system?</p><p>The answer is simulation.</p><p>Although the mathematical laws of the universe prevent us from generating an elegant formula for the state of an orbital system in the future, they do not prevent us from simulating such a system to any degree of accuracy we demand (provided we have enough time/computational resources). We can use such simulations to make accurate predictions about the future, letting us sleep easy at night, knowing that, at the very least, planetary collision will not be our downfall any time soon.</p><p>In this post, we walk through the physics and the code required to simulate a simple system of planetary motion using Python. Using some basic ideas from high school physics and rudimentary Python, we can create some stunning visual simulations. Before we get there though, we need a recap of the laws of motion.</p><h2 id="The-Physics-of-Planetary-Motion">The Physics of Planetary Motion</h2><h3 id="The-Setup">The Setup</h3><p>To keep things simple (both in terms of the physics and resulting visualisations), we restrict ourselves to a two-dimensional universe. We will, however, discuss how to generalise the methods demonstrated here to three dimensions at the end of the post.</p><p>As with any physics problem, we have to start with some assumptions.</p><p>The first of these is assuming that all planetary bodies act as point masses. That is to say, even though the bodies have a non-zero radius and therefore an area, we assume that the entirety of their mass is located at the centre. This makes calculations related to gravitational forces far easier with minimal impact on the resulting values in most circumstances. Secondly, if there are any collisions between the masses, moving forward we shall treat them as a singular body with a mass equal to the sum of the two that collided.</p><p>We also assume that the forces acting on our planetary bodies are constant over very short durations. This allows us to use a simple set of equations known as SUVAT (more on this later) instead of relying on complex integral calculus. This assumption is largely reasonable, only failing substantially when we get close to massive bodies (such as a black hole or neutron star), at which point the outcome of motion (collision and merging) is essentially determined already.</p><p>We also make some minor assumptions, such as treating all planetary bodies as circular.</p><p>Under these assumptions, and given the initial positions, velocities, and masses of our bodies (plus some cosmetic conditions that are not necessary for the physics), our goal is to simulate the resulting planetary motion.</p><h3 id="Deriving-Motion">Deriving Motion</h3><p>With our assumptions in place, we can begin to calculate the trajectories of our planetary bodies. As discussed in the introduction to this piece, there is no closed form solution for the positions in a system of 3 or more bodies at any given time. That said, we can use our second assumption from above to accurately progress the motion one small timestep at a time.</p><p>To do this, we take the positions and masses of the objects at any given timestep, and use these to calculate the instantaneous forces between all bodies in the simulation. From this, we can calculate accelerations, velocities and, finally, the positions of the bodies at the next timestep. At this point the process is repeated, building up a realistic simulation of planetary motion, piece-by-piece.</p><p>It follows that the first problem we need to solve is how to calculate the force acting on any particular body at an instant of time. The most straightforward method of doing this is to decompose the overall force into its <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.625em;vertical-align:-.19444em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.03588em">y</span></span></span></span> components using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine.

The hallmark of these conferences are the Leaders’ speeches, where the current head of the party aims to appeal to their party base or even attract some new voters through media coverage.</p><h2 id="Data-Background">Data Background</h2><p>This analysis would not have been possible without the transcripts provided by <a href="http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Political Speech</a>. They describe themselves as “an online archive of British political speech and a place for the discussion, analysis, and critical appreciation of political rhetoric” and produce speeches dating back to 1895.</p><p>For my study, I aim to observe the nuances of party conference leadership speeches from 2010 to 2018. These dates were chosen as they coincide with a change in the British political landscape, following the 2010 election whilst still providing us with enough data to conduct meaningful analysis. For this study, I will only observe the three ‘mainstay’ political parties: the Conservatives, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Upon importing and tidying the data, we can observe the 5 most used words within the speeches.</p><table><caption>A tibble: 5 × 2</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col">Word</th><th scope="col">Count</th></tr><tr><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;int&gt;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>the</td><td>8777</td></tr><tr><td>to</td><td>5279</td></tr><tr><td>and</td><td>5033</td></tr><tr><td>of</td><td>3898</td></tr><tr><td>a</td><td>3470</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are no surprises here. In fact, the top 5 most used words here are from the top 6 most used words in the English language according to the <a href="https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/2822326" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford English Corpus</a>, a text corpus comprising over 2 billion words.</p><p>Carrying on our analysis with these common words would create a dull analysis, so to counteract this, we will temporarily remove them. We do this using the <code>tidytext</code> package in R, which contains a comprehensive list of <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/tidytext/man/stop_words.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop words</a>. These are common words in the English language which would add nothing to certain parts of our analysis if they were to be included. A separate dataframe was created to store the non-stopwords which totalled 56,989 words, meaning that 105,883 words were removed.</p><div class="note info"><p>It is worth noting, that there is no definitive list of stopwords. Instead, different words would be considered stopwords depending on the context, although we have just used a generic list for simplicity. We will see later in the post, a more nuanced way of handling uninformative words called TF-IDF.</p></div><p>We can now observe the most used 5 non-stopwords.</p><table><caption>A tibble: 5 × 2</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col">Word</th><th scope="col">Count</th></tr><tr><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;int&gt;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>people</td><td>1207</td></tr><tr><td>country</td><td>684</td></tr><tr><td>government</td><td>598</td></tr><tr><td>party</td><td>577</td></tr><tr><td>britain</td><td>568</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is more like what we would have expected the vocabulary of a Leader’s speech to look like.</p><p>We can go further and visualise the set of each party’s 100 most commonly used non-stopwords through wordclouds. This is done below in each party’s traditional colour. (Blue for Conservative, Red for Labour, Yellow for Liberal Democrat).</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/leaders-speeches/leaders-speeches_16_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>We can see that the words identified to be most common before appear most often in these wordclouds too (denoted by their large size). The only visible differences are the party’s names, particularly visible for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Here we see the obvious flaws in word clouds, they barely allow us to observe any differences between the parties and provide no numerical insight. We will aim to address this weakness later with different methods.</p><p>Before we dive into some more detailed text analysis, we could have a quick exploration of the word count for each Leader’s speech.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/leaders-speeches/leaders-speeches_20_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>From this, we can see that Ed Miliband can be quite the rambler at times.</p><h2 id="Text-Analysis">Text Analysis</h2><h3 id="Analysing-Sentiment">Analysing Sentiment</h3><p>Basic counts and summaries are great, but with modern data science techniques, we can go much further. For example, we can infer the sentiment (loosely, how positive or negative in tone) each speech is.</p><p>We do this by referencing the contents of each speech against the AFINN lexicon, created by Finn Arup Neilson. This lexicon assigns an integer value from -5 to 5 to a vast number English words with negative numbers indicating negative sentiment and positive numbers indicating positive sentiment. Here we list a random word for each sentiment value.</p><table><caption>A grouped_df: 11 × 2</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col">Word</th><th scope="col">Value</th></tr><tr><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;dbl&gt;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>son-of-a-bitch</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>fraudulence</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>lunatics</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>lethargy</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>manipulation</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>some kind</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>cool</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>courtesy</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>cheery</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>winner</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>superb</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>We can then take an average of the sentiments over all word in each speech and visualise it to see the trend of speech sentiment over time. This is conducted on the dataset with stopwords included, otherwise it could distort the sentiment (though note that most stopwords have a neutral sentiment).</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/leaders-speeches/leaders-speeches_28_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>As we can see, the speeches are overwhelmingly positive, with the only negative score being Jeremy Corbyn’s 2018 speech to the Labour Party conference. Other notable values include David Cameron’s consistency between 2010 and 2015 for the Conservative Party and the significant jump in positivity when Theresa May took over the Conservative Leadership in 2016.</p><h3 id="Term-Frequency-and-Zipf’s-Law">Term Frequency and Zipf’s Law</h3><p>We have seen that raw word counts on their own aren’t particularly useful. One flaw of many is that longer texts will naturally have higher word counts for all words. Instead, a more useful metric is how often a certain word (also called a term) appears as a proportion of all words.

In fact, George Zipf, a 20th century American linguist created <em>Zipf’s law</em>. This formalises the above observation, stating that the frequency that a word appears in a text is inversely proportional to its rank.</p><p><span class="katex-display"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Term Frequency</mtext><mo>∝</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mtext>Rank</mtext></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Term Frequency} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Rank}}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-.19444em"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Term Frequency</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span><span class="mrel">∝</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.2777777777777778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:2.00744em;vertical-align:-.686em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:1.32144em"><span style="top:-2.314em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Rank</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:.04em"></span></span><span style="top:-3.677em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:.686em"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Put simply, the most frequent word will appear at twice the rate of the second most frequent word and at three times that of the third most frequent word.</p><p>Zipf’s law is largely accurate for many natural languages, including English (though as always, there are exceptions).

obtain some interesting results here. For example, it’s clear to see the Liberal Democrats’ sharp pivot to a anti-Brexit strategy following the referendum of 2016. Or how in 2014, the Conservatives announced their plan to increase the 40% income tax threshold (known as the 40p tax rate). We also see Jeremy Corbyn’s plan for a ‘kinder’ politics emerge in his first conference speech as leader in 2015, alongside the Grenfell Tower disaster mentioned in 2017.</p><p>The names such as ‘Harry’ and ‘Maurice’ that crop up here were intriguing at first glance. These were in reference to ‘Harry Beckough’ and ‘Maurice Reeves’, who were, respectively, a longstanding Conservative member and a furniture shop owner whose premises was burned to the ground during the London riots.</p><h3 id="Complexity-Consideration">Complexity Consideration</h3><p>There are a number of ways that we can observe the complexity of a text, or in this case a speech. For this piece we choose the average number of syllables per word. The data for this was taken from the <code>quanteda</code> package and we can visualise the results as so.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/leaders-speeches/leaders-speeches_54_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>We can see profound variations between different leaders in this plot. Ed Miliband and David Cameron, the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives who gave speeches between 2010-2014 and 2010-2015, respectively, had a much lower complexity than the most recent leaders such as Jeremy Corbyn of Labour and Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats, who together count for the top 6 most complex speeches.</p><div class="note success"><p>We used mean syllable count in this piece as a metric for speech complexity as it is simple for a layperson to understand. That said, there are many more subtle and interesting complexity measures available through <code>quanteda</code>, such as the Flesch–Kincaid readability score.</p></div><h3 id="A-Different-Way-of-Deciding-Elections">A Different Way of Deciding Elections?</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/first-past-the-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Past the Post system</a> is often bemoaned in the UK as being unsuitable for modern-day politics. Now, it is not my place to comment on this system but if pushed to suggest another system, the aforementioned <code>Quanteda</code> package does give us another option…</p><p>We can calculate the mean scrabble score per word of the leader’s party conference speech each year! First let us observe the most impressive efforts that the politicians managed:</p><table><caption>A tibble: 5 × 5</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col">Party</th><th scope="col">Year</th><th scope="col">Leader</th><th scope="col">Word</th><th scope="col">Scrabble Score</th></tr><tr><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;int&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;dbl&gt;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2018</td><td>Theresa May</td><td>czechoslovakia</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2013</td><td>Nick Clegg</td><td>unequivocally</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2017</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>overwhelmingly</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2017</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>democratization</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2015</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>fizzing</td><td>29</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Theresa May managed an incredible score of 37 in 2018 with ‘Czechoslovakia’ but this would of course be disqualified for being a proper noun. As a result, Nick Clegg holds the record with 30 points scored for ‘unequivocally’! We can also visualise the mean score per word as follows.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/leaders-speeches/leaders-speeches_60_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>As we can see, the Conservatives, who have been in power since 2010 would not win a single year should it be decided by Scrabble. In fact, the Liberal Democrats would win 6 out of the 9 years we have studied with Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, taking the other 3 years—I’m sure both parties would be happy with that in hindsight!</p><p>Just in case anyone was under any illusion, of course mean Scrabble score is a poor way of deciding elections and I am not endorsing its use—at the very least, a game of Pictionary would be more appropriate…</p><h2 id="Takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>With that, I end my brief incursion into British political speeches. While I have barely begun to scratch the surface of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, I hope that I have shown the power of the ways that these techniques can be used to summarise large pieces of text through sentiment, TF-IDF and syllable complexity.</p><p>I had minimal experience with NLP methods upon embarking on this project and would like to thank WDSS (in particular, Janique Krasnowska) for supporting me until completion. I feel like I’ve learned a lot and certainly furthered my knowledge and experience. I would suggest anyone who would like to conduct some data science studies outside their degree looks out for research opportunites with WDSS and seizes them with both hands—I will certainly be looking out for more chances!</p><h2 id="Appendix-Summary-Table-of-All-Speech-Metrics">Appendix: Summary Table of All Speech Metrics</h2><table><caption>A tibble: 27 × 8</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col">Party</th><th scope="col">Year</th><th scope="col">Leader</th><th scope="col">Number of Words</th><th scope="col">Mean Sentiment</th><th scope="col">Top TF-IDF Word</th><th scope="col">Mean Word Syllables</th><th scope="col">Mean Scrabble Score</th></tr><tr><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;int&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;int&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;dbl&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;chr&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;dbl&gt;</th><th scope="col">&lt;dbl&gt;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2010</td><td>David Cameron</td><td>6247</td><td>0.38866397</td><td>harry</td><td>1.439020</td><td>7.435761</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2011</td><td>David Cameron</td><td>6132</td><td>0.40983607</td><td>euro</td><td>1.450808</td><td>7.538034</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2012</td><td>David Cameron</td><td>6070</td><td>0.47016706</td><td>rise</td><td>1.403032</td><td>7.367087</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2013</td><td>David Cameron</td><td>5917</td><td>0.45477387</td><td>finish</td><td>1.400913</td><td>7.401018</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2014</td><td>David Cameron</td><td>6104</td><td>0.49638554</td><td>40p</td><td>1.378480</td><td>7.304463</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2015</td><td>David Cameron</td><td>6676</td><td>0.45546559</td><td>extremism</td><td>1.443745</td><td>7.463356</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2016</td><td>Theresa May</td><td>7187</td><td>0.88888889</td><td>plays</td><td>1.476137</td><td>7.568521</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2017</td><td>Theresa May</td><td>7113</td><td>0.63288719</td><td>dream</td><td>1.485799</td><td>7.432207</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative</td><td>2018</td><td>Theresa May</td><td>7120</td><td>0.54709419</td><td>proposal</td><td>1.483296</td><td>7.571831</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2010</td><td>Ed Miliband</td><td>6168</td><td>0.40265487</td><td>recognises</td><td>1.480791</td><td>7.348780</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2011</td><td>Ed Miliband</td><td>5891</td><td>0.56207675</td><td>bargain</td><td>1.393482</td><td>7.288363</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2012</td><td>Ed Miliband</td><td>7390</td><td>0.40898345</td><td>succeeded</td><td>1.388167</td><td>7.134647</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2013</td><td>Ed Miliband</td><td>7954</td><td>0.74186992</td><td>race</td><td>1.370724</td><td>7.068717</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2014</td><td>Ed Miliband</td><td>5697</td><td>0.79874214</td><td>ethic</td><td>1.437664</td><td>7.322393</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2015</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>7178</td><td>0.47313692</td><td>kinder</td><td>1.530257</td><td>7.609025</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2016</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>5894</td><td>0.43455497</td><td>migrants</td><td>1.569805</td><td>7.809402</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2017</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>5965</td><td>0.08439898</td><td>grenfell</td><td>1.585235</td><td>7.864050</td></tr><tr><td>Labour</td><td>2018</td><td>Jeremy Corbyn</td><td>5703</td><td>-0.04136253</td><td>palestinian</td><td>1.564188</td><td>7.706432</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2010</td><td>Nick Clegg</td><td>4354</td><td>0.16060606</td><td>plural</td><td>1.457425</td><td>7.571065</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2011</td><td>Nick Clegg</td><td>4257</td><td>0.06571429</td><td>barons</td><td>1.471583</td><td>7.604947</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2012</td><td>Nick Clegg</td><td>4328</td><td>0.33333333</td><td>maurice</td><td>1.468837</td><td>7.439471</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2013</td><td>Nick Clegg</td><td>5927</td><td>0.49206349</td><td>liberal</td><td>1.475379</td><td>7.538670</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2014</td><td>Nick Clegg</td><td>6241</td><td>0.33682008</td><td>dems</td><td>1.494074</td><td>7.640180</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2015</td><td>Tim Farron</td><td>5804</td><td>0.12616822</td><td>liberal</td><td>1.462427</td><td>7.327490</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2016</td><td>Tim Farron</td><td>6178</td><td>0.21428571</td><td>brexit</td><td>1.454840</td><td>7.391953</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2017</td><td>Vince Cable</td><td>5139</td><td>0.20505618</td><td>brexit</td><td>1.574762</td><td>7.818679</td></tr><tr><td>Liberal Democrat</td><td>2018</td><td>Vince Cable</td><td>4364</td><td>0.08626198</td><td>brexit</td><td>1.544255</td><td>7.863584</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></content>

      <title>A Polish Approach to Countdown</title>
      <link href="/polish-countdown/"/>
      <url>/polish-countdown/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p><strong>Accessing Post Source</strong><br>We are still working on getting this site set up, so source code for this post is not yet available. Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>Last night, to celebrate the end of term one, WDSS ran a social based on the classic British gameshow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Countdown</a>. Countdown consists of two games—focused on numeracy and literacy, respectively—as well as a bonus condundrum. For this post we’re going to take a look at the numbers game, and see how we can use some relatively basic Python coding to build an automatic solver for the problem.</p><p>The motivation for writing this post (on top of it just being fun to do some Pythonic problem-solving) is two fold:</p><ol><li><p>A solution to the Countdown numbers game can be created using the concepts taught in WDSS’s Beginner’s Python course. This makes a nice example of how we can apply the learnings from the course to a real problem. Specifically, we will be manipulating lists (session 5), writing functions (session 6), and using a built-in Python library for benchmarking our solution (session 8).</p></li><li><p>The main personal appeal of this problem, is that there is a clever way of looking at it which makes deriving a solution much simpler. We will talk about this more in the body of the post, but the key idea is that, when programming, the way you choose to represent the problem makes a massive impact on the complexity of your solution. This idea is vital for completing coding assessments for job applications or for competing in coding competitions (such as WDSS’s <em>12 Days of Python</em>—coming soon, so keep your eyes on our socials!).</p></li></ol><p>Before we start to build our solution, let’s quickly recap the rules of the Countdown numbers game:</p><ul><li>Six numbers are chosen at random for the contestants to use.</li><li>A three-digit target number is chosen at random.</li><li>The contestants are given 30 seconds to get as close to the target number as possible using only the operators <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">+</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.66666em;vertical-align:-.08333em"></span><span class="mord">+</span></span></span></span>, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.66666em;vertical-align:-.08333em"></span><span class="mord">−</span></span></span></span>, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\times</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.66666em;vertical-align:-.08333em"></span><span class="mord">×</span></span></span></span>, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>÷</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\div</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.66666em;vertical-align:-.08333em"></span><span class="mord">÷</span></span></span></span>.</li><li>Not all numbers need to be used, and each number can only be used once</li><li>At all times, the running total must be a non-negative integer</li></ul><p>Points are then awarded to each contestant based on how close they came to the target number.</p><div class="note info"><p>The rules above are deliberately brief.

id="Brackets-Begone">Brackets Begone</h2><p>Although working through the vast possible combinations of numbers and operations to reach the target is a difficult task for a human, this is actually a fairly lightweight task for a modern computer. Even if we take a brute force approach, simply testing every possible way of arranging the numbers, we will still only need a matter of seconds to reach a solution.</p><p>That said, such a brute force solution will not scale way. Add more operators and increase the amount of numbers available and the solution’s runtime will grow exponentially, quickly becoming intractable even on the fastest computing hardware.

This would certainly be a valid approach, but it would also be nightmarish to code up.</p><p>The reason for this, is that there is an implicit restriction that our brackets must match. Furthermore, this is not a simple rule:</p><ul><li>Brackets must be opened before being closed</li><li>By the end of the expression, all brackets must be closed</li><li>Brackets must contain a meaningful expression (i.e. we would want to bracket a single number)</li></ul><p>Even if we could somehow find the energy to create such valid bracketed expressions, we would still have the issue of having to determine when brackets add value; in many cases, brackets are redundant and so we would be wasting time checking equivalent solutions multiple times.</p><p>It may seem at this point that we’ve reached a dead end. Either we have to give up or face the complexities of efficiently iterating over these expressions. Thankfully, though, there is an alternative solution which will drastically simplify our approach.</p><h3 id="Polish-Notation">Polish Notation</h3><p>From our early years we start to build up a sense of what maths <em>looks</em> like. It’s always the same pattern: take two numbers, slap an operator between them, and you’re done. Obviously, there are many elements of mathematical notation that do not follow this template, but it is certainly true for lowest level building blocks of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p><p>We are so used to this way of performing arithmetic, that it may seem strange to even consider that there could be another way. Nevertheless, there is, and it has some remarkable properties that will make you question why we even bothered with our usual notation in the first place.</p><p>This new mathematical system is known as Polish notation, named for the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented the method in 1924. The difference between this system and our standard approach is that we always put the operator before the two values it acts on, rather than in between.

That said, even the most basic solution will almost always find a solution in less than a second (requiring around a minute to find <em>all</em> solutions).</p><p>We improve on this naive approach by considering the skeleton of a solution. This is a term I have coined to refer to the patterns of operators and numbers in a solution. For example a skeleton could be <code>OONNOONONNN</code>, where <code>O</code> represents an operator and <code>N</code> a number. It is simpler conceptually (though admittedly not great for performance) to store a skeleton as a list of positions where we have operators. In this case, the above skeleton would be represented by <code>[0, 1, 4, 5, 7]</code>.</p><p>This sounds like a lot of work but the benefit is massive. This is because there will be many skeletons that are invalid. We can therefore discard them before trying to fill them with numbers or operators, saving a lot of time in the process. We can check that a skeleton is valid by noting that each operation requires two inputs and returns one. For that reason, we can loop through the skeleton from left to right as we always do with Polish notation, incrementing our number count ever time we see a number, and decreasing it if we see an operator. As long as we never come across an operator whilst we have one or less numbers left, we have a valid skeleton.</p><h3 id="The-Code">The Code</h3><p>With that in mind, we can look at the following

Python is not-renowned for the speed of its loops and so we likely lose a considerable amount of efficiency in doing this. We can largely mitigate this issue by using JIT-compiled Python, which optimises our code before running it to make loops and other slow techniques more efficient.</p><p>One approach to this is using <a href="https://www.pypy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyPy</a> a JIT-compiled implementation of Python. Alternatively (and my preference), you can use <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numba</a>, a package for JIT-compiling the standard Python implementation. Numba also has great compatibility with NumPy, which could perhaps be used to extract further performance.</p><h3 id="Guided-Search">Guided Search</h3><p>Currently, our approach is searching the solution space completely at random. This is a valid approach when we want every solution, but not when we need just one. Instead, we might want to look into an approach that <em>searches</em> for a solution. This could be based on an evolutionary method or by building a sort of tree structure connecting solutions together (perhaps working towards and back from the solution at the same time). These ideas are far beyond the scope of an introductory tutorial, but are worth looking into if this sort of problem interests you.</p><h3 id="Optimisations-and-Branch-Cutting">Optimisations and Branch-Cutting</h3><p>Finally, there are still many time-saving tricks we can use with our existing approach.</p><p>The most pressing optimisation, is to avoid copying memory around. At many points in our code we are moving and creating new memory. <a href="https://github.com/rvedotrc/numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It is possible</a> to create an implementation in which we only have one state that is modified as we search the space of solutions.</p><p>We could also avoid identical solutions, perhaps by enforcing that addition and multiplication expressions have their operands in ascending order. In a similar way, we can avoid multiplying by 1, as this does not change the solution.</p><p>These small changes add up and could lead to an implementation capable of finding all solutions in a matter of seconds.</p>]]></content>

Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo is a computational method that uses samples to understand complex distributions. It takes these samples by simulating a cleverly constructed Markov chain for a long time. This method has proven useful in many problems in areas such as fraud detection, modelling genetic networks and deciphering codes.</p><p>In this post, I use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to answer an interesting question regarding the knight, a powerful chess piece whose movement is much unlike any other:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose a knight is moving randomly about a chessboard. If you were to observe the position of the knight at some random time way out in the future, what is the probability that the knight is on any specified square?</p></blockquote><p>Here, moving randomly means that, at each step, the knight’s next move is chosen uniformly from all legal moves. For example, if the knight is on a corner square then it has 2 possible legal moves, each with probability <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.190108em;vertical-align:-.345em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:.845108em"><span style="top:-2.6550000000000002em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:.04em"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:.345em"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span></span></span></span> of occurring.</p><h2 id="A-Bit-About-Markov-Chains">A Bit About Markov Chains</h2><p>A stochastic process is a mathematical system that transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules.

It is also positive recurrent, although this is harder to prove.</p><p>It is also useful to note, that if the knight is currently on a black square, and then takes an odd number of moves, it is guaranteed to end up on a white square. And so, in particular, for the knight to return to any square visited, it must take an even number of moves from when it was last on the square. In addition, a return to any square can be made in just 2 moves simply by jumping to any other square and then back. All states in the knight’s Markov chain therefore have period 2. This means the chain is not aperiodic, which will cause us some minor inconvenience later.</p><h3 id="Stationary-Distributions">Stationary Distributions</h3><p>The probability distribution of a Markov chain will generally change as time progresses.

distribution converges.</p><p>The penultimate image—obtained from a simulation of the knight taking one million moves—is almost equal to the true stationary distribution. It shows that, if you were to observe the position of a knight taking random legal moves on a chessboard at some random time way out in the future, the knight is most likely to be on one of the 16 central squares and very unlikely to be on one of the four corner squares. This intuitively makes sense, as each square in the central light blue area can be reached by a knight in 8 different positions, whereas each corner square can only be reached by 2 positions.</p><p>The stationary distribution is naturally independent of the starting position of the knight.

Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>Understanding and respecting data privacy is an increasingly important responsibility, which all data controllers and processors must take when handling personal information. But what do we mean when we talk about data privacy? And how can we go about measuring something as abstract and conceptual as anonymity?</p><p>In this article, we investigate a recently proposed statistical metric used to measure the privacy of trajectory datasets. We consider the capabilities and limitations of the method and illustrate the process of measuring privacy using a publicly available dataset of mobile spatio-temporal data.</p><div class="note info"><p>Trajectory data records the locations of moving objects at specific times and is a critical resource for studying human behaviour, environmental changes, and traffic systems.</p></div><h2 id="What-is-Privacy">What is Privacy?</h2><p>Before we go about measuring it, it’s a good idea to have a firm understanding of exactly what we mean when we talk about privacy in a data scientific context. We usually consider privacy to be the extent to which an individual is able to limit or control access to their personal information. However, data privacy is a little bit more general; it refers to the protections or safeguards against the potential misuse of an individual’s data with reference to their rights and consent.</p><h3 id="Privacy-vs-Security">Privacy vs Security</h3><p>Whereas data security places its focus on protecting an individual’s data by implementing techniques such as authentication, encryption and access control, data privacy is more concerned with mitigating against the risk that the data you provide to others, either knowingly or unknowingly, is used for nefarious purposes. This risk can manifest anywhere from tracking your location in real-time to showing you targeted adverts without your consent; both can represent a breach of your individual privacy.</p><p>Privacy is not necessarily the same as security; in fact, it is often the case that people are asked to decrease their standards for individual privacy to safeguard a society’s safety and security in the face of crime and terrorism. Similarly, privacy campaigners and activists argue that a decrease in security is an acceptable risk to maintain every individual’s right to privacy and civil liberties.</p><div class="note warning"><p>The line between privacy and security is often blurred and is frequently contested by academics and industry professionals alike. Whatever your opinion on the matter, it is universally acknowledged that an understanding of both concepts is a critical asset to anybody working in data science.</p></div><h3 id="Hiding-in-Plain-Sight">Hiding in Plain Sight</h3><p>Similarly to how data security experts have access to a wide range of tools such as encryption and authentication, data privacy experts have their own arsenal of techniques on hand to help mitigate privacy risks. One of the most common techniques used to enhance data privacy is anonymisation, a process by which an individual’s data can be published in a dataset, without revealing their identity or other sensitive information.</p><p>Let’s consider a data schema that might reasonably be collated by the MyWarwick application. It contains personal information about each student (their name, date of birth and university ID), the location of the student collected through the application (remember, MyWarwick requests location permissions to improve its campus map) and each student’s mark for a recent Tabula assignment.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Full Name</th><th style="text-align:center">Date of

data processor, Warwick Analytica, with the brief of identifying whether there is a correlation between student location and the mark they achieved in the assignment. However, before they can release the data, they are required to anonymise it.</p><p>The simplest form of anonymisation is the redaction of personally identifiable information—data which is very likely, if not guaranteed, to be unique to a single individual. Examples might include your full name and date of birth, your National Insurance number or university ID. The inclusion of personally identifiable information in a dataset significantly increases the likelihood and severity of a potential privacy attack, so it is often completely removed (data sanitisation) or replaced with an artificial identifying value (data pseudonymisation) instead.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Pseudonym</th><th style="text-align:center">Location</th><th style="text-align:center"><strong>Mark</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>1d36cc</code></td><td style="text-align:center"><code>52.379925, -1.557104</code></td><td style="text-align:center">54%</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>e1f999</code></td><td style="text-align:center"><code>52.282188, -1.531144</code></td><td style="text-align:center">95%</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>c60764</code></td><td style="text-align:center"><code>52.384243, -1.559346</code></td><td style="text-align:center">68%</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="+0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.53em;vertical-align:-.03em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">⋮</span><span class="mord rule" style="border-right-width:0;border-top-width:1.5em;bottom:0"></span></span></span></span></span></td><td style="text-align:center"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="+0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.53em;vertical-align:-.03em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">⋮</span><span class="mord rule" style="border-right-width:0;border-top-width:1.5em;bottom:0"></span></span></span></span></span></td><td style="text-align:center"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="+0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.53em;vertical-align:-.03em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">⋮</span><span class="mord rule" style="border-right-width:0;border-top-width:1.5em;bottom:0"></span></span></span></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This way, it’s a lot harder for an observer to learn sensitive information about a target individual from the data—but it’s not impossible.</p><h3 id="Background-Knowledge">Background Knowledge</h3><p>Although this process successfully guarantees anonymity in isolation (i.e. when we have no extra information outside of the data), with additional background knowledge, it’s still possible to perform a privacy attack on users in the dataset.</p><p>Let’s say you know that your friend Hugh, who completed the assignment, is currently at home in Jack Martin 2 (<code>52.379925, -1.557104</code>). By linking this information with MyWarwick’s ‘anonymised’ data, we can isolate Hugh’s mark of 54% as well as his pseudonym (which could be used to identify him in other datasets)—all without his consent.</p><p>Similarly, if Nyla was the student in the dataset who achieved a mark of 95% and later posted about her success on a public LinkedIn or Instagram page, this data could still be used to isolate her current location (<code>52.282188, -1.531144</code>—most likely a well deserved celebratory coffee at Procaffeinate) and her pseudonym.</p><p>These example privacy breaches are extreme and arguably unlikely; however, it demonstrates that anonymised data rarely exists in isolation. Background knowledge for a dataset will always exist in some form, and each piece of background information constitutes a privacy risk to the anonymised dataset.</p><p>For that reason, in order to limit the effectiveness of reidentification attacks, we often employ more rigorous methods of guaranteeing the privacy and anonymity of data than just data sanitisation or pseudonymisation.</p><div class="note success"><p>More information about these techniques, including <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.69444em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.03148em">k</span></span></span></span>-anonymity, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">l</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.69444em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.01968em">l</span></span></span></span>-diversity and differential privacy, can be found <a href="https://arx.deidentifier.org/overview/privacy-criteria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p></div><h2 id="How-is-Privacy-Measured">How is Privacy Measured?</h2><p>Privacy is a difficult quality to measure for a dataset, principally because it’s difficult to formally define. Unlike other statistical properties of data, there is no universally agreed formula or procedure to measure privacy. As a result, it’s difficult for data collectors to communicate the extent to which user data is anonymised or handled in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>Before we can explore a recently proposed metric used to measure the risk of reidentification in a dataset, we need to make a few tweaks to a well-known children’s board game…</p><h3 id="Guess-Who">Guess Who?</h3><p>In the popular board game <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guess Who?</a></em>, players take turns requesting and revealing information about a face on their respective, identical boards. Each player selects, or is dealt at random, an identity relating to a face on the board; to win, they must deduce their opponent’s identity before their opponent can do the same.</p><p>Each turn, the requester asks the revealer to disclose a feature about their selected face, to which the revealer responds honestly. From this information, the requester may be able to reduce their pool of potential secret identities the revealer may have adopted.

Instead, we can limit our dataset to a single day (01/06/2014) in the 6-month period and use this as a representative sample to estimate the unicity for the full time period.</p><p>Furthermore, we want to change the way that the dataset considers the time at each data point. Having time represented as a range between a start point and an end point is helpful if we want to investigate the duration of mobile data usage, but for our purposes, it’s more useful to have data recorded at a single point in time as opposed to a time interval, so that it becomes a trajectory of locations over time. To achieve this, we take the midpoint of the start and end time and round it to a suitable time interval of 60 minutes. This has the added positive effect of coalescing groups of high frequency, low duration records into single data points.</p><p>Following the data cleaning procedure, the dataset now contains 20851 records, representing the movements of 2979 users on 01/06/2014.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Location</th><th style="text-align:center">User ID</th><th style="text-align:center">Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>31.237872/121.470259</code></td><td style="text-align:center"><code>edbc54...</code></td><td style="text-align:center">2014-06-01 11:00:00</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>31.237872/121.470259</code></td><td style="text-align:center"><code>f8206a...</code></td><td style="text-align:center">2014-06-01 08:00:00</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="+0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.53em;vertical-align:-.03em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">⋮</span><span class="mord rule" style="border-right-width:0;border-top-width:1.5em;bottom:0"></span></span></span></span></span></td><td style="text-align:center"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="+0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.53em;vertical-align:-.03em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">⋮</span><span class="mord rule" style="border-right-width:0;border-top-width:1.5em;bottom:0"></span></span></span></span></span></td><td style="text-align:center"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="+0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.53em;vertical-align:-.03em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">⋮</span><span class="mord rule" style="border-right-width:0;border-top-width:1.5em;bottom:0"></span></span></span></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Developing-the-Experiment">Developing the Experiment</h3><p>To perform analysis on our cleaned dataset, I developed a Python module called <code>unicity</code> to facilitate the calculation of unicity in arbitrary datasets.

This would also reveal their pseudonym identifier to you, allowing you to track their movements across the city for the entire 6 month time period included in the dataset.</p><p>However, these results also highlight an important limitation of unicity. Shanghai is a city with over 24 million inhabitants, and yet, our findings appear to suggest that just 5 spatio-temporal points are sufficient to reidentify any inhabitant with over 99% accuracy. Is this really the case?</p><p>The answer is no, because our data only takes into consideration the movements of 2979 out of the 24 million inhabitants of Shanghai. Therefore, any probabilities relating to the reidentification of an individual which are derived from unicity are limited by the constraint that the individual is known to be in the dataset. Otherwise, we don’t have enough information to derive the probability of reidentification for the wider population.</p><p>This is the primary limitation of unicity and similar privacy metrics: because it only gives us the risk of reidentification for individuals within a dataset, we can’t extrapolate this information to find the risk of reidentification for a wider population without additional data. This limits the applicability of unicity to real-world contexts because it’s very rare to have enough data to represent an entire population.</p><p>However, this limitation doesn’t stop unicity from excelling at one of its best applications: comparing the efficacy of different methods of increasing privacy in a dataset.</p><h3 id="Zoom-and-Enhance">Zoom and Enhance</h3><p>The granularity of information in a dataset has a substantial impact on the privacy of individuals in the dataset. For example, tracking your precise location every second provides almost no privacy, whereas tracking your location to the nearest postcode every hour provides offers much more. This is because the data becomes more generalised as its resolution decreases; in other words, because there are several people passing through the same postcode every hour, the individual risk to privacy is reduced.</p><p>Our dataset carries spatio-temporal information about users, so we can adjust the spatial and temporal resolution of our data and measure the effect this has on privacy using unicity. However, because the dataset already uses a discrete set of points to represent location data (the locations of base stations in Shanghai), it is more difficult to change our spatial resolution. We can, however, easily modify the temporal resolution of our data by changing the time interval used when rounding time midpoints during the data cleaning process.</p><p>Comparing unicity over <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.625em;vertical-align:-.19444em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">p</span></span></span></span> with temporal resolutions of 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes and 240 minutes, we find the following results:</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/quantifying-anonymity/quantifying-anonymity_19_0.png"  alt=""></p><div class="note info"><p>For temporal resolutions of 180 and 240 minutes, some unicity values are not defined.

We’ve used a metric for measuring the risk of reidentification in a dataset, unicity, to demonstrate how background knowledge can allow us to reidentify individuals based on their location data with high accuracy. We’ve also shown that, to increase the privacy of users in a dataset, you can lower the temporal resolution of your data to make it appear more generalised.</p><p>What this article has intentionally not addressed is why you should care about privacy; an area often seen as the more political or sociological aspect of data privacy. Regardless of your opinions towards the importance of individual privacy, this article has demonstrated how easy it is for the illusion of privacy to be shattered by seemingly insignificant pieces of background information. Furthermore, understanding the ways in which privacy can be compromised is an important step in the direction of learning how to responsibly collect, clean, store and process information from individuals who are protected by data protection law; a skill necessary for all data scientists. Hopefully, that’s an idea we can all get behind.</p><p><em>The <a href="http://sguangwang.com/TelecomDataset.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dataset</a> used in this article is publicly available and was provided by academics from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

      <title>The Trump Effect: Can Data Explain What We Never Saw Coming?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p><strong>Accessing Post Source</strong><br>We are still working on getting this site set up, so source code for this post is not yet available. Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>Looking back four years ago to the United States’s 2016 Presidential election, it can be easy to forget how confident people were that Trump couldn’t possibly win the race. With the 2020 election fast approaching, it is critical that we can understand what led to his victory and how that might influence the upcoming result. We will do this not by relying on speculation or political opinion, but by showcasing a data-driven regression model that we can use to reliably intuit the primary demographic and socio-economic factors that led to Trump’s victory. In doing this, we seek to answer two questions:</p><ol><li><p>Despite his overall unpopularity, how did Trump pull off an election victory?</p></li><li><p>Why did this come as such a surprise?</p></li></ol><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/newspaper_headlines.jpg"  alt="Newspaper headlines incorrectly predicting a loss for Trump"></p><h2 id="How-Trump-Won-and-Lost">How Trump Won (and Lost)</h2><div class="note info"><p><strong>A Brief Introduction to the Electoral College</strong><br>The Electoral College is the United State’s electoral system, which allocates each of its 50 states plus DC a set number of votes, loosely (though not exactly) based on their populations. The winner of the plurality vote in each state receives that state’s full number of college votes (with the exception of Maine and Nebraska).</p></div><p>To address our first question, despite losing the national popular vote, Trump was returned as president in 2016 by the electoral college. That is, despite having less votes overall, the states that he did win were such that he ended up with more college votes allocated to him than Clinton did, and so claimed his victory. This is intuitive when we see that Clinton won heavily in large states, such as California (by a wide 30% margin), giving her 55 college votes, whilst Trump won by less than a percent in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as taking Florida by 1.2%, winning him 75 college votes for these alone. These small wins count for far more than Clinton blowing Trump away in California, since a state victory leads to the same amount of college votes regardless of the margin.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_7_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Since this system is so state-centric, we can pinpoint exactly where Trump won electoral votes that in turn won him the election. There were only six states that changed party, all switching from voting Obama to voting Trump. This can be shown on an electoral map of the US. All states which voted Republican in 2012 and 2016 are in red, whilst blue denotes the same for the Democrats. Greyed states are those which voted Obama, then Trump. Effectively, these 6 states decided the president.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/changing_states.png"  alt="State color changes from 2012 to 2016"><br>Incredibly, of these 6 states, 4 of them were won by a percent or less. In the others—Ohio and Iowa—Trump saw a huge swing his way, winning both by close to 10%.<br>Aside from these margins, the other crucial thing to note is the geographical proximity of 5 of these states. Broadly, these are all part of the midwest, and make up a region known as the “rust belt”. These used to be manufacturing powerhouses of the US, are largely white, and (owing to the US’s departure from a manufacturing economy) have rising unemployment. One of the key outcomes of this project is to demonstrate that Trump’s departure from typical Republican vote shares gave him the perfect coalition of states to win the White House without needing the national popular vote. To understand exactly how these states shot him to victory, we’ll need a statistical model to help us grapple with the complexities of election dynamics.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_11_0.png"  alt=""></p><div class="note success"><p>You will likely notice the outlying state of Utah, coloured purple. We explain the cause of this deviation in our <a href="#outliers">section on model outliers</a>.</p></div><h2 id="Modelling-the-Problem">Modelling the Problem</h2><p>In order to understand what led to Trump’s victory, we needed to develop a model that can capture the complex relationships between voter attributes and election outcomes. After trawling the web for relevant data sources, we ended up with enough fine-grained data to model the problem at a county level. This included demographic and socio-economic breakdowns for each county, as well as the presidential election vote counts for the years 2008, 2012, and 2016.</p><div class="note info"><p><strong>Data Sources &amp; Variable List</strong><br>A summary of the data sources used for this analysis can be found at <a href="https://github.com/warwickdatascience/wdss-research-website/tree/master/content/trump-effect/data/sources.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> and a list of included variables can be found in <a href="#appendix">the post appendix</a>.</p></div><p>We took this data and formed a model in which we aimed to predict, for each county, the difference in Republican vote share from 2008/2012 to 2016 based on the descriptors we had available. By inspecting the coefficients of this model, we would then be able to intuit the impact that various demographic and socio-economic factors had on Trump’s victory.</p><p>This framework of modeling is highly complex, with a large number of correlated inputs and two correlated outputs (the 2008/16 and 2012/16 differences). A naïve approach would be to fit a multivariate <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/ordinary-least-squares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OLS model</a>, but this would almost certainly suffer from <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/multicollinearity-in-regression-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multicolinearity</a>. This is a phenomenon in linear modelling that occurs when combinations of predictions are highly correlated with others. This can have a severe impact on our regression coefficients, making it near impossible to determine which factors actually influenced the outcome.</p><p>A common workaround is to implement <a href="https://learnche.org/pid/latent-variable-modelling/principal-components-regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principal component regression (PCR)</a>, which prevents multicolinearity by first projecting the input predictors to a lower dimensional space in which all variables are orthogonal. This method still has its drawbacks, however; namely, the projection is chosen to maximise variance in the predictor space only, not taking into account which combinations of predictors are actually good for predicting. This could easily lead to scenarios in which valuable input variables are discarded in the projection because they don’t express much variance.</p><p>To combat this issue, we decided to use a slightly more complex model known as <a href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial least squares (PLS) regression</a>. This is a model used heavily in cheminformatics and signal processing for its ability to robustly handle highly-correlated predictors and responses without sacrificing predictive accuracy. The model is trained using a simple interative procedure, resulting in standardized coefficients, giving the predicted impact of each input factor on the response. In our case, we can use these coefficients to understand which demographic and socio-economic factors had the largest impact in Trump’s victory.</p><p>By using a statistical model such as PLS regression, we are able to capture relations that are unlikely to be detected with a simple model or by rudimentary data visualisation. This allows us to draw detailed political insight, in the knowledge that our results are backed by data and rigourous statistical methods. This is the power that data science brings to this analysis, letting us answer old questions in new, insightful ways.</p><div class="note info"><p><strong>Code Attributions</strong><br>Data scraping and initial model development was performed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janique-krasnowska-94a1a0195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janique Krasnowska</a>, with support, final tweaks and statistical write-up by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hargreaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Hargreaves</a>. The intial modelling framework and data sources were suggested by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-palmer-61954a177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Palmer</a>, the author of this post.</p></div><div class="note success"><p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>If you wish to learn more about PLS regression and its implementation in R, the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pls/vignettes/pls-manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following vignette</a> is a great starting point.</p></div><h2 id="Explaining-Trump’s-Victory">Explaining Trump’s Victory</h2><div class="note danger"><p><strong>Risk of Misinterpretation</strong><br>To avoid misuse of our models, it is important to highlight two key facts:</p><ul><li>All patterns shown in this post are correlations, not causations. By combining these trends with political theory and performing appropriate tests on our model, we can be more more confident in the causal nature of such patterns, but we can never be sure</li><li>The standardised coefficents from the model shown below do not directly relate to the impact of different factors on Trump’s swing, but rather give relative values more appropriate for comparison. Our PLS has the potential to give absolute coefficients, but we have omitted these in this post for simplicity and clarity.</li></ul></div><h3 id="Age">Age</h3><p>We began our exploration by testing the theory that support for Trump largely grows with increasing demographic age. Interestingly, our results support a more nuanced view, suggesting that his appeal is more generational, and that Trump’s main gain was from an older, yet still working age, demographic.</p><div class="note warning"><p><strong>Understanding Standarised Coefficient Plots</strong><br>This section contains several visualisations of the standardised coefficients from our model. These show the influence of a given predictor on the likelihood of Trump gaining a vote over a previous Republican candidate. In other words, a large positive coefficient means that a certain factor in a population led to Trump gaining votes, a large negative coefficent relates to Trump losing votes, and a small coefficient implies the factor had little impact.</p></div><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_28_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>This is an unusual finding, and we take two conclusions from this. Firstly, the generational divide in politics does exist. In terms of Trump-populism, there is no linear adage we can apply, such as “the older you get, the more conservative you become”. Instead the trends are highly generational (think baby boomers, Generation Z, millennials, etc.). This cyclic nature of history is supported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/history-as-a-giant-data-set-how-analysing-the-past-could-help-save-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Turchin’s recent work</a> suggesting that many historical and political trends can be modelled surprisingly well using periodic systems. Secondly, a key base of Trump’s was the older working population; people in full-time work, but pre-retirement seemed to be particularly enamored with Trump’s message compared with previous Republicans’.</p><h3 id="Industry">Industry</h3><p>With the knowledge that Trump swung five “rust belt” states his way, and that these are known for their waning manufacturing industries, it was critical that we included industry breakdowns in our model formulation. From this, we found a strong positive swing to Trump from production workers, corroborating the theory that this is how he swung these particular states. Clearly, this played a huge part of his campaign, aiming rhetoric at returning jobs to America and backing American manufacturing.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_32_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>This massive shift in voter base was essential for Trump’s win, as it allowed him to unexpectedly take the midwest, with it’s large proportion of production workers.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_34_0.png"  alt=""></p><h3 id="Race">Race</h3><p>The graph above also hints that race played a large role in Trump’s victory. Our model confirms this, highlighting in particular that white people swung heavily towards Trump, whereas black and hispanic people swung away. This is particularly relevant to the midwest, since it is one of the whiter areas of the US, meaning Trump’s success here, and therefore in the election at large, can be partially attributed to his success in winning over white people.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_36_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>In fact, our data had a higher fidelity than race alone, including the intersection of common races and sexes. This allows us to also note, perhaps unsurprisingly, that Trump gained more male votes than female, regardless of race.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_38_0.png"  alt=""></p><h3 id="Religion">Religion</h3><p>Effectively coding religious demography proved challenging, as there are a huge range of denominations, many having relatively few adherents. Our goal was to balance out religous fidelity with introducing too many variables as to add noise to the model. In the end, we separated Evangelical groups into their own category, as there was (and still is) <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/intelligencesquared/whydoevangelicalsworshipatthealtarofdonaldtrump-withsarahposnerandbrianklaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of speculation</a> that they played a crucial role in his victory. Despite this, the data strongly suggests that this variable is largely unimportant, as Trump seemed to lose Evangelical votes, but still performed well enough to win in Republican heartlands. The swing against Trump in the “bible belt” was minor, and insufficient to change the election outcome. This a fascinating example of how data science lets us see past our preconceptions and biases, to understand problems with greater clarity.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_41_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>For reference, the religious distributions for both the midwest and remaining US are shown below.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_43_0.png"  alt=""></p><h3 id="Education-Income">Education &amp; Income</h3><p>The crucial findings in this area show us both how different Trump was as a candidate compared to previous Republicans, and also how largely unimportant certain swings were. In terms of education, Trump was incredibly unpopular, facing a large negative swing from bachelor’s degree holders. However, this did little to impact his success. One explanation for this is that educational attainment is concentrated in areas where Democrats are already successful, so in the “winner takes all” system of the US, a further loss was largely irrelevant.</p><p>Conversely, unemployment and poverty correlated positively with Trump voters, further backing our argument of him taking traditional Democrat voter groups.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_45_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>The impact of the change in Trump’s appeal towards bachelor’s degree holders is easily seen when we plot a heatmap of bachelor degree attainment; a dark patch is centred lower midwest where key swing states are located.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_47_0.png"  alt=""></p><h3 id="Outliers">Outliers</h3><p>Overall, we believe that our model is a strong success. Not only does it provide evidence for several previously speculative theories, it also casts doubt on some unproven beliefs. Our model captures a good proportion of the variability of the response with a desirable error distribution.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/trump-effect/trump-effect_50_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>As with all models, outliers exist, but these can be easily explained. On one end (marked blue), we overpredicted the swing from several counties in Utah and Idaho. That is, based on the trends we saw elsewhere, our model suggested he should have performed better than he did. This deviation from our predictions can be explained in one word—Mormons. Many counties in this region of the US were settled by the Church of Latter Day Saints, leading to a third Mormon candidate, Evan MacMullin, claiming a sizeable share of votes (20% in Utah, 6% in Idaho) largely from Trump, leading to this minor discrepancy in our model.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have areas such as Laporte County, Indiana (marked green) which we underpredicted. In other words, Trump did better in these areas than our model predicted. This is partially explained by Trump choosing Mike Pence to be his running mate. VP candidates are often hand-picked to help “deliver” a region. In this case, Pence was a longterm governor from a rust belt state. The model does not have a way to account for the running mate effect (though this could be introduced with manual feature engineering), hence underpredicted the swing Trump will have obtained from choosing Indiana-favourite Pence as running mate.</p><div class="note success"><p>Although we’ve only showed the 2008–2016 differences here, the outliers for 2012 are largely similar, though exacerbated even further by the fact that Utah was 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s home state.</p></div><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>With that, we conclude our whirlwind tour of Trump’s 2016 presidential victory. Our model has cast light on Trump’s effect and dependence on a unique coalition of states in order to pull off his unexpected win. Upon analysing trends in historical patterns, we find that traditional left/right distributions (such as income and religion) were largely unimportant in this election, particularly compared to education levels and industry distributions.</p><p>Our work also highlights the groups that Trump must retain in order to win again in 2020. Much is made of his performance with evangelical groups—traditionally bastions of the Republican party—but our data-driven approach shows that this is largely a side factor, contrary to popular speculation. To win again, Trump doesn’t need more votes in evangelical areas—the &quot;bible belt” as it is usually known—but instead, he must retain workers in the production industry, and the older working generation. This enabled him to win the midwest states that were sufficient to edge him into the White House and could quite possibly keep him there.</p><p>This project showcases data science at its best, bringing together statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to solve an old problem in a new way. With this collaboration of disiplines, such conclusions would not be possible: political speculation and theory would lack supportive evidence that can only be derived through advanced statistical modelling; on the other hand, without the ability to tie model results to reality using domain knowledge and insight, the practicality and real-life validity of a statistical model can rarely be relied upon. This project was only facilitated by Warwick Data Science Society’s community of students and the infrastructure they provide for blogging. We hope that this post inspires fellow students to consider the insight that data science can bring to their field and to engage with WDSS to produce similar works.

      <title>A League of Its Own: Rethinking University League Tables</title>
      <link href="/league-of-its-own/"/>
      <url>/league-of-its-own/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>This post is the corresponding write-up for a WDSS project in which a pair of society members collaborated to produce a web app for visualizing university league table data. You can view the final product at <a href="https://app.wdss.io/league-table-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</p></div><h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2><p>The power of data manifests itself not only in accessiblity, but in usability. Without the ability to present trends and patterns in an understandable form, we cannot answer the questions we care about, and so data provides us less value than it is capable of.</p><p>This scenario presents itself in regard to university ranking data. There is a lot of year-on-year variation in university rankings; take as an example, the overall ranking of the University of Warwick in the last five years, spanning the range from 8th to 11th. This temporal evolution is often overlooked in making university choices, despite it being likely to have a significant impact on how one’s degree is viewed in the future.</p><p>The reason for this oversight is that all the most popular ranking websites display only the current year’s data by default. Any long-term comparison has to be done by manually accessing data for different years, requiring considerable time and effort. This led us to question whether we could collate this data and present it in a more usable form, capable of displaying these long-term trends.</p><p>This project demonstrates the usefulness of web scraping in obtaining larger datasets for comparative purposes than we would be able to otherwise. It also highlights the importance of effective visualizations in data science and how they make data more interpretable and accessible. Two members of WDSS collaborated on this project: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hargreaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Hargreaves</a>, who developed the app and scraped the ranking data, and I (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janique-krasnowska-94a1a0195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janique Krasnowska</a>), who performed the initial data exploration and communicated the findings.</p><h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2><div class="note info"><p>The source code for the web app and scraping scripts have been open-sourced in <a href="https://github.com/warwickdatascience/league-table-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this repository</a>.</p></div><p>The entire project was developed using the language R. We began by scraping data from the <a href="https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete University Guide</a> using the <code>rvest</code> package. In doing this, we obtained data for 187 universities and 70 courses, spanning the past 13 years; 45,580 individual observations in total. Needless to say, it would be counterproductive to attempt to combine the insights from this data in just one graph. Instead, we opted for an interactive web app that allows the user to choose the universities and courses they may be interested in.</p><p>This app was implemented using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiny</a>, a framework developed by RStudio that makes it easy to build interactive web applications directly from R, with very limited knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We used two graphics libraries for the visualisation; ggplot is responsible for the backbone of the graphs and Plotly adds an additional layer of interactivity. For example, Plotly makes it possible for the user to hover over a data point on a graph and have detailed information related to that observation displayed.</p><p>There are two types of comparisons a user can make: the same course at multiple universities or multiple courses at the same university. More complex comparisons would also be possible with more complicated code, but one might question the usefulness of comparing Archaeology at Oxford with Economics at Warwick, for example.</p><p>To make discovering trends easier, we included a LOESS smoothing feature in the app. LOESS is a non-parametric method based on moving averages that constructs a smooth curve of best fit for the data points. It helps us to filter out noise and focus instead on general trends. For example, we can see in recent years that Warwick’s mathematical prowess is decreasing whilst Durham overtakes. By choosing to show extra features when hovering, we can see that Durham now outperforms Warwick across all the Complete University Guide metrics (entry standards, student satisfaction, research intensity, and graduate prospects).</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/league-of-its-own/durham_warwick_comp.png"  alt="Comparing Mathematics course at Warwick and Durham"></p><h2 id="Takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>This small coding project demonstrates some of the core values of data science—obtaining data of interest with the help of programming software and presenting the gained insights in a way that is accessible to a lay person.

      <title>Money for Nothing: An Arbitrage Paradox</title>
      <link href="/money-for-nothing/"/>
      <url>/money-for-nothing/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Utilising the concept of arbitrage can be a lucrative opportunity when done correctly. Yet somehow, when done incorrectly, the results can be even more propitious (at least for one of the parties involved). In this post, we will walk through a paradox related to arbitrage in which the seemingly obvious fair price for an asset results in a strategy for obtaining infinite wealth.</p><h2 id="The-Financial-Jargon">The Financial Jargon</h2><div class="note warning"><p>If you are already familiar with the notions of options and arbitrage, you may wish to skip to the <a href="#the-paradox">next section</a>.</p></div><p>To make this post inclusive to all, we will begin by offering a brief, requisite understanding of the financial vocabulary used in this post, before attempting to describe the paradox itself.</p><p>In the financial world, it is hard to avoid the words <em>stocks</em> and <em>shares</em>, so we will begin by defining these. A stock is a type of security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a company. This entitles the owner of the stock to a fraction of the corporation’s assets and profits proportional to how much stock they own. A share is simply the smallest denomination of a company’s stock and acts as a unit for measuring one’s stake in a company.</p><p>Another key financial concept is that of the <em>option</em>. These are financial instruments based on the value of underlying securities (such as stocks). Since the value of an option is dependent on the value of another financial asset (or assets), it is a type of derivative. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell the underlying asset within some fixed timeframe for a predetermined price. The two most common types of options are <em>calls</em> and <em>puts</em>; a call allowing the holder to buy the asset whereas a put offers the sale. It is important to note, that an options contract puts the holder under no obligation to buy/sell the asset within the agreed upon timeframe (unlike a futures contract). Instead, they are free to exercise the option only when it benefits them financially.</p><p>There are a several components of an options contract, such as the premium, strike price, expiration date, and contract size, but we will focus only on the premium and strike price in this post. The premium is the down payment that the holder of the contract pays for having the right to exercise an options trade. This is paid regardless of whether the holder exercises the option. The strike price is the price at which the holder of the option can buy/sell the underlying security if they decide to exercise it. Note, that this is a fixed price and so does not change, even though the value of the underlying security might.</p><p>This brings us to <em>arbitrage</em>. Arbitrage is the act of simultaneously buying and selling assets or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms, to take advantage of different prices of the same asset. It exploits the price difference that arises as a result of market inefficiencies and is usually considered useful to markets, as it helps to re-establish efficiency. However, this opportunity is usually captured by automated trading software, making it nearly impossible for anyone to take advantage of directly.</p><h2 id="The-Paradox">The Paradox</h2><h3 id="Setup">Setup</h3><p>Say one share of stock is currently worth <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">£</mi><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">£100</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.69444em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord">£</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span>.

Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>Unsurprisingly, human language seem intuitive to humans, but that is not the case for a computer. On the other hand, though we can easily determine whether two words share a similar meaning, if asked to give a quantitative reason as to why that is the case, we will may struggle to reach a satisfying answer. Thankfully, our shortcoming is where computers thrive, as they are remarkably good with numbers and tabular data. All this leaves us to do is to translate our problem into such a numeric system. Word embedding is a technique to take language and transform it into this computer-friendly format so we can take advantage of computing power for solving natural language processing tasks.</p><h2 id="Background">Background</h2><h3 id="The-Need-for-Word2vec">The Need for Word2vec</h3><p>Initial attempts at solving this problem before word embeddings included one-hot encoding. The essence of this process is to represent our text as a sequence of vectors in a space with number of dimensions equal to the number of words in our corpus. We assign each word its own dimension so that each word vector is orthogonal to the others. Technical details aside, this isn’t practical to model anything on the scale of human languages, as the vector dimensions would be the size of the language (and as a results, storage and computational requirements would be astronomical). More importantly, however, this doesn’t capture any sort of similarity between two words (since ever vector is mutually orthogonal to the others). As far as this method is concerned, the words ‘dolphin’ and ‘neoliberal’ are equally similar to ‘shark’. Word2vec aims to solve this problem by providing word embedding which take into account relations between words. In essence, word2vec provides a canvas (albeit a strange multi-dimensional one) where any possible word in the language could lie, and plots points on this canvas for each word in our corpus. How close any two points on this canvas lie (captured mathematically by the cosine distance) should therefore correspond to how likely humans are to describe the respresented words as “similar”.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/word2vec/word2vec_6_0.png"  alt=""></p><h3 id="Deriving-the-Word-Embeddings">Deriving the Word Embeddings</h3><p>To derive each word embedding, the word2vec model is usually trained using a method called Skipgram with Negative Sampling (SGNS). Essentially, a large corpus (typically billions of words) is fed to the model, and an <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-sized sliding window is used to capture the words that lie either side of each word in the corpus to determine each word’s context. The context for each word is then used to determine the word’s embedding vector, with the negative sampling process controlling the rate at which these weights are updated to reduce computation time and produce a more robust result. Because words with a similar context usually have closely-linked meanings, such words will end up having similar embedding vectors too.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/word2vec/sliding_window.png"  alt="The sliding window used in word2vec training"><br>Take the above diagram as an example.

After many adjustments each time they are found in the corpus, their vectors will provide an increasingly accurate represention of the “fox” and “bear” relation—types of animals.</p><h2 id="Application">Application</h2><div class="note info"><p>The following examples are derived from a word2vec model trained on the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google News dataset</a>, featuring over 100 billion words taken from various news articles.

What’s fascinating, however, is that multiple facets of the word ‘queen’ are captured; we see that ‘Bowie’ is also relatively close to ‘Queen’ due to the word’s relation to the iconic rock band.</p><p>Naturally, with vectors come mathematical operations, and the real power of word2vec starts to emerge. Vector differences are the crux behind <em>analogies</em>, a concept best explained through examples…</p><h3 id="Analogies">Analogies</h3><h4 id="Starting-With-a-Classic">Starting With a Classic</h4><p>The most infamous example of the use of word2vec is answering the question, “Man is to woman, as king is to…what?”.

To get word2vec to return this result, we have to phrase the question in the language of arthimetic; that is, <code>king + (woman - man)</code>. In other words, we are taking the word ‘king’ and asking what the corresponding word would be if added the difference between ‘woman’ and ‘man’. This may seem unituitive—why can’t we just add ‘woman’ to ‘king’? The reason for this is that the word ‘king’ already has ‘man’ as a component of its vector representation. Therefore, if we simply added ‘woman’ without first subtracting ‘man’ we end up with components of both ‘woman’ and ‘man’ which confuses the model, leaving us with nonsensical results.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Invalid approach: king + woman = ...</span></span><br><span class="line">print_similar(model.most_similar(positive=[<span class="string">'king'</span>, <span class="string">'woman'</span>], topn=<span class="number">1</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><pre><code>man (0.663)</code></pre><h3 id="Plurals">Plurals</h3><p>We can use this system of analogy solving for finding the singular and plural forms of words. With a rather mundane example such as <code>gloves + (bike - bikes)</code>, it’s not unsurprising the model returns ‘glove’; it could simply be obtained from deciphering that the pattern is removing the trailing ‘s’—hardly groundbreaking. But when talking about irregular plurals, the required task to output the derived word shifts from spotting a simple pattern to seemingly needing a human-like understanding of the structure and complexities of the English language. Never-the-less, word2vec is up for the challenge.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># foot + (cacti - cactus) = ...</span></span><br><span class="line">print_similar(model.most_similar(positive=[<span class="string">'foot'</span>, <span class="string">'cacti'</span>], negative=[<span class="string">'cactus'</span>], topn=<span class="number">1</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><pre><code>feet (0.568)</code></pre><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># child + (sheep - sheep) = ...</span></span><br><span class="line">print_similar(model.most_similar(positive=[<span class="string">'child'</span>, <span class="string">'sheep'</span>], negative=[<span class="string">'sheep'</span>], topn=<span class="number">1</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><pre><code>children (0.726)</code></pre><p>Here, ‘sheep’ is both the singular and the plural, meaning the result of the word arithmetic is still ‘child’.

      <title>Higher or Lower: Reinventing a Classic Card Game</title>
      <link href="/higher-or-lower/"/>
      <url>/higher-or-lower/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>This post is the corresponding write-up for a WDSS project in which a small team of society members collaborated to produce a web-toy that plays a game of Higher or Lower using the Twitter follower counts of celebrities. You can play this game at <a href="https://app.wdss.io/higher-or-lower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</p></div><h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Sometimes, simplicity is beautiful. Higher or Lower is a game embodying this philosophy. Played solo with a standard deck of cards, play consists of revealing these one at a time after first guessing whether the next card will have a higher or lower value. In recent years, this game has been re-envisioned as a <a href="http://www.higherlowergame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular web toy</a>, in which card values are replaced by the number of global monthly Google searches for various topics. Not wishing to limit ourselves to search results, we decided to implement our own online version of the classic game based on the follower counts of Twitter celebrities. The final app can be found at the link above, and we will spend the rest of this post looking into the techniques behind our approach as well as reviewing the lessons this project can teach us about collaborative data science at WDSS.</p><p>For our purposes, this project is an ideal medium to practise web scraping and creating sharable products for others to enjoy. Web scraping is a way of extracting data from websites, leveraging automation to gather information efficiently and without unnecessary repetition. In all, three members of WDSS worked on this project, combining their specific skills to develop the final product. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hargreaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Hargreaves</a>, focused on the backbone of the app, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhbardsley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Bardsley</a>, the visuals of the game, and I (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parthdevalia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parth Devalia</a>) have responsibility for the communication of results.</p><h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2><div class="note info"><p>The source code for the web app and scraping scripts have been open-sourced in <a href="https://github.com/warwickdatascience/higher-or-lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this repository</a>.</p></div><p>With 330 million monthly users, Twitter has become an indispensable medium for instant news and opinions from politicians, brands, and of course, celebrities. Manually defining celebrityhood and iterating through matching accounts would be a difficult task, so we decided to look at what existing resources we could take advantage of. We eventually settled on a website called <a href="http://profilerehab.com/twitter-help/celebrity_twitter_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfileRehab</a>. On this site, links to celebrities’ Twitter accounts are sorted into categories. By scraping this information we were able to collect Twitter profile URLs for around five hundred celebrities, matched to their names. We then interfaced with the Twitter API to read their respective follower counts and download their profile pictures. This entire scraping process was performed using Python, to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of web scraping packages the language has.</p><p>You may well be asking, “What is an API?”, and so I will take a moment to introduce this term. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) simply allow applications to communicate with each other and are responsible for much of the connectivity we rely upon. They act as messengers, taking your request, telling the target application what you want to do, and then returning the response. Rather than accessing the application server directly, APIs offer us a dedicated access point, improving security and reliability. A common analogy is that of a restaurant—the API is the waiter, the interface between your table and the kitchen, taking your request and returning the response (the food).</p><p>With regard to our project, we decided to access the data we wanted through an API as Twitter have made recent obfuscations to their website code to make direct scraping more difficult. Use of Twitter’s API, as is often the case, is subject to terms and conditions regarding the usage of the data obtained. Additionally, the company have implemented a rate limit; that is, a maximum number of requests they can handle in a given timespan (just like with a restaurant waiter). Careful examination of these limitations needs to be considered when using an API, but fortunately we found them to be adequate for our needs.</p><p>The application is made using Shiny, a package for the R programming language that allows you to build interactive web applications. The framework allows for the development of powerful and flexible web applications with no need for HTML, CSS or JavaScript knowledge. For this reason, Shiny stands out for its unrivalled speed of development.</p><p>Despite its benefits, the raw product of Shiny development is not always the prettiest and can lack strong mobile support. To overcome this, Matthew implemented additional styling using CSS to improve the aesthetics of the final application.</p><h2 id="Takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>This project allowed us three WDSS members to work together in creating something that we wouldn’t have done individually. Further, if not for the society, we would not have had the opportunity to work together. This highlights the role of WDSS, bringing people from different backgrounds together to solve challenging problems.</p><p>Projects are extremely important in growing your skills and are critical for developing a strong portfolio. Through collaboration, we can see problems from new perspectives, build our professional networks, and gain experience of working in a team. This is in comparison to university work, that is often done alone without using real world data, and usually without a solid final product.</p><p>This project leverages infrastructure offered by WDSS, such as our blogging platform and Shiny server. For this reason, alongside the support<br>offered by experienced students, working with WDSS to complete research makes it easier to get projects off the ground and showcase what you can do.</p><p>Thank you for reading and we hope you enjoy playing our implementation of Higher or Lower.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Urban Cities: A History Told By Data</title>
      <link href="/urban-cities/"/>
      <url>/urban-cities/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p><strong>Accessing Post Source</strong></p><p>We are still working on getting this site set up, so source code for this post is not yet available. Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/barcelona.jpg"  alt="The skyline of Barcelona"><br>An aerial observer would be forgiven for mistaking Barcelona’s octagonal blocks and diagonal streets as some red-brick reimagining of Legoland. Indeed, Spain’s 2000-year-old capital is a strict grid-like design, engineered to tackle overpopulation while maximizing airflow for its inhabitants. It’s an ancient city with all the efficiency of contemporary urban structures like New York.</p><p>Barcelona is a fascinating example, but its grid-like patterns are obvious to the human eye. I wondered about other cities with more complex features. What subtle quirks lie in the road/street structures of Bristol, Newcastle or Coventry?</p><p>For that question I wanted a scientific answer, so I set about applying data science to learn more about the intricacies of the UK’s densely populated cities.</p><h3 id="Methodology">Methodology</h3><p>This project was made possible by <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM). OSM is a world-wide database of roads, trails and streets, verified by field maps and aerial imagery and maintained by an active community of engineers and GIS professionals. Its open API enables raw geodata to be sourced on any city in the world.</p><p>OSM describes geodata elements in a number of ways. Linear features, like roads or rivers, are modelled using a “way”: nodes (between 2 and 2000) connected into a simple chain of line segments, a polyline. Most whole cities with solid polygon geometries (Manchester and Birmingham to name a few) are bounded by a single “closed way”, with the same start and end nodes. These are generally those with a well-defined natural border in the real world. Others, that have no obvious boundary, are rather represented as a single point marker, denoting the center of the city. We will be focusing on the former type as the more complex definition of the geometry allows us to draw far more insight.</p><p>Of the UK cities with these ‘nice’ geometries, the twelve with the largest populations were considered and OSM API was used to fetch full network graphs, from which the bearings of streets were determined. A summary of this data is shown below.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>geometry</th><th>place_name</th><th>bbox_north</th><th>bbox_south</th><th>bbox_east</th><th>bbox_west</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>0</th><td>POLYGON ((-2.03365 52.40231, -2.03322 52.40217...</td><td>Birmingham, West Midlands Combined Authority, ...</td><td>52.608706</td><td>52.381053</td><td>-1.728858</td><td>-2.033649</td></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.80042 53.88595, -1.80041 53.88594...</td><td>Leeds, Yorkshire and the Humber, England, Unit...</td><td>53.945872</td><td>53.698968</td><td>-1.290352</td><td>-1.800421</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.80147 53.48098, -1.80049 53.48027...</td><td>Sheffield, Yorkshire and the Humber, England, ...</td><td>53.503104</td><td>53.304512</td><td>-1.324669</td><td>-1.801471</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>POLYGON ((-2.06125 53.82562, -2.06017 53.82504...</td><td>Bradford, Yorkshire and the Humber, England, U...</td><td>53.963151</td><td>53.724341</td><td>-1.640330</td><td>-2.061248</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>POLYGON ((-2.31992 53.41161, -2.31847 53.40999...</td><td>Manchester, Greater Manchester, North West Eng...</td><td>53.544592</td><td>53.340104</td><td>-2.146829</td><td>-2.319918</td></tr><tr><th>5</th><td>POLYGON ((-3.01917 53.43616, -3.01806 53.43323...</td><td>Liverpool, North West England, England, United...</td><td>53.474967</td><td>53.311543</td><td>-2.818000</td><td>-3.019173</td></tr><tr><th>6</th><td>POLYGON ((-2.71837 51.50617, -2.71837 51.50616...</td><td>Bristol, City of Bristol, South West England, ...</td><td>51.544432</td><td>51.397284</td><td>-2.510419</td><td>-2.718370</td></tr><tr><th>7</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.62490 53.65363, -1.62488 53.65358...</td><td>Wakefield, Yorkshire and the Humber, England, ...</td><td>53.741811</td><td>53.575349</td><td>-1.198814</td><td>-1.624898</td></tr><tr><th>8</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.61446 52.42795, -1.61412 52.42774...</td><td>Coventry, West Midlands Combined Authority, We...</td><td>52.464772</td><td>52.363885</td><td>-1.423957</td><td>-1.614459</td></tr><tr><th>9</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.24696 52.95344, -1.24689 52.95317...</td><td>City of Nottingham, East Midlands, England, Un...</td><td>53.018672</td><td>52.889008</td><td>-1.086119</td><td>-1.246956</td></tr><tr><th>10</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.77567 54.98962, -1.77566 54.98955...</td><td>Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, North East...</td><td>55.079382</td><td>54.959032</td><td>-1.529200</td><td>-1.775672</td></tr><tr><th>11</th><td>POLYGON ((-1.56888 54.92462, -1.56824 54.92409...</td><td>Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, North East England,...</td><td>54.944170</td><td>54.799042</td><td>-1.345665</td><td>-1.568879</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Visualizations">Visualizations</h2><p>For each of these 12 cities, the returned bearings were weighted by street length to produce the following visualisations using simple polar projection plots. It is important to note two key points about this approach:</p><ol><li>The bearings of streets were derived from only their start and finish nodes, ignoring paths in-between. This was to ensure reasonable computation times as an alternative to using the full polylines.</li><li>Naturally, bearings are rotationally symmetric as we do not account for the direction of one-way streets.</li></ol><h3 id="Birmingham">Birmingham</h3><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/urban-cities_11_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Birmingham’s visualization is unmistakably circular. Many older cities lack a grid structure, with impromptu-built streets going off in many different directions. The place now called “Birmingham” has been around for more than 1,400 years. It was believed to have been established by a Saxon tribe, before expanding over the centuries into the city of 8500 streets we know today.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/prospect_of_birmingham.jpg"  alt="William Westley's 1732 Prospect of Birmingham"></p><h3 id="Manchester-Newcastle">Manchester &amp; Newcastle</h3><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/urban-cities_15_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Manchester displays quite a clear cross-like visualization. This city has an interesting grid structure with a strong emphasis on moving north-to-south. The east-to-west flow is perhaps due to Manchester sitting almost directly between Liverpool and Sheffield, and the reduced SE/NW activity might result from its position just in the upper left of the Peak District.</p><p>Newcastle is similar but for a more obvious reason; its central ring-road system, which is vaguely hexagonal, is presumably responsible for the high degree of symmetry we observe.</p><h3 id="Coventry">Coventry</h3><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/urban-cities_18_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Not unlike Manchester, Coventry’s visualization hints at a grid-like design. Famously, this ancient city—once a hotspot of trade for cloth and textiles—was obliterated in 1940 by a series of bombing raids, now called the Coventry Blitz. In the decades following, the city’s remains were rebuilt into a modern grid structure.</p><h3 id="Bristol">Bristol</h3><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/urban-cities_21_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>For a city founded on the turn of the second-last millennia, we wouldn’t expect to see much beyond a uniformly distributed set of bearings. Yet Bristol’s otherwise almost-circular plot is cut along the NE/SW line. Modern Bristol is dominated by the M5, as well as the River Avon. It’s interesting that a 1960s motorway construction can have such an impact on the bearings of an ancient city.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>As well as analyzing the street orientations of individual cities, it is beneficial to to showcase their visualizations side-by-side to draw comparisons and appreciate relative differences. To extend, I have collated the visualizations for the twelve cities I considered into one final image.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/urban-cities/urban-cities_25_0.png"  alt=""></p><h3 id="The-Importance-of-Data-Science">The Importance of Data Science</h3><p>I think it important to observe how data science, once a niche and theoretical discipline, can offer such rich insights into the history of the UK’s major cities. From Birmingham’s pre-industrial beginnings, to the devastating campaigns of the German Luftwaffe, these simple visualisations tell stories of our past. They compress a millennia-long archive of the achievements and failures that gave rise to modern Britain.</p><p>To that extent, if you are a data scientist wondering how you can apply your technical skills to real-world projects, or a student with domain expertise, keen to build up the technical skills to answer the questions you care about, make sure you follow Warwick Data Science Society <a href="https://www.facebook.com/warwickdatascience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social media</a> to keep up-to-date with relevant opportunties. These include academic talks, data science news, workshops, and beginners programming courses, so there is certainly something for everyone.

important detail to note is that there are 395 high school students in the math dataset and 649 in the Portuguese dataset. The grades of the student are from 0 to 20. Furthermore, there are 16 numerical variables out of 33; the rest of the variables will need to be one-hot encoded when we will analyze correlations and build the regression model.</p><p>Now let’s visualize the final grades distributions for both subjects.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/school-success/school-success_13_0.png"  alt="Distribution of student grades for math and Portuguese"></p><p>We can also calculate that the average final grades for math and Portuguese students are 10.42 and 11.91, respectively. This suggests that Portuguese students score higher on average than math students although this comparison could easily have been skewed by the large number of math students scoring zero.</p><h3 id="Finding-and-Visualizing-Correlations-for-Numerical-Variables">Finding and Visualizing Correlations for Numerical Variables</h3><p>We are now going to automatically find the variables with the strongest correlation to the final grades for both datasets. Finding correlations between non-numeric features and the outcome can get a bit messy, so we will focus on testing only the existing numerical values of the datasets at first. To better visualize the insights, we will also use correlation bar plots and heat maps for both datasets.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/school-success/school-success_17_0.png"  alt="Correlations between numeric predictors and the response for math"></p><p>To interpret correlation bar plots and heat map:</p><ul><li>The darker the bar/square, the stronger the correlation is.</li><li>Brown represents negative correlations, whereas purple represents positive correlations.</li></ul><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/school-success/school-success_19_0.png"  alt="Correlations between numeric predictors and the response for Portuguese"></p><p>Insights:</p><ul><li>For both datasets, the number of past classes <code>failures</code> has a strong negative correlation with <code>G3</code>.</li><li>Other common variables with a negative correlation are <code>age</code>, frequency of going out with friends (<code>goout</code>), <code>traveltime</code>, <code>freetime</code> and <code>health</code>.</li><li><code>G1</code> and <code>G2</code> have very strong positive correlation coefficients for both datasets because student performance usually remains constant throughout the year; we will therefore ignore them.</li><li>Other common variables with a positive correlation are: <code>studytime</code>, education of parents (<code>Fedu</code> and <code>Medu</code>) and family relationship (<code>famrel</code>).</li></ul><h3 id="One-Hot-Encoding">One-Hot Encoding</h3><p>In order to get more insight from these datasets, we need to be able to use the categorical variables as well. An example of categorical variable is the <code>school</code> variable (the student is either at Gabriel Pereira or Mousinho da Silveira) as there are multiple possible values with no intrinsic ordering. We will use a technique called one-hot encoding, which assigns binary value to each category level indicating whether or not that level was the value of the original predictor.

The missing detail is that we often drop the first of the resulting binary columns. The reason we do this is that knowing the value of the other columns is enough to be certain of the value of the first. Indeed, if all of the other columns are zero, then the first column must be one, and vice-versa. Removing the first column is important as the algebra behind linear regression fails we duplicate predictor information.</p></div><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">one_hot_encode</span><span class="params">(df)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Select only categorical variables</span></span><br><span class="line">    cat_df = df.select_dtypes(include=[<span class="string">'object'</span>])</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># One-hot encode variables</span></span><br><span class="line">    dummy_df = pd.get_dummies(cat_df, drop_first=<span class="literal">True</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Add the response back and return</span></span><br><span class="line">    dummy_df[<span class="string">'G3'</span>] = df[<span class="string">'G3'</span>]</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> dummy_df</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># One-hot encode both datasets</span></span><br><span class="line">dummy_dfm = one_hot_encode(data_m)</span><br><span class="line">dummy_dfp = one_hot_encode(data_p)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Finding-and-Visualizing-Correlations-for-Encoded-Categorical-Variables">Finding and Visualizing Correlations for Encoded Categorical Variables</h3><p>We can now analyze the correlation coefficients for the final grades of all the variables for both datasets.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/school-success/school-success_28_0.png"  alt="Correlations between categorical predictors and the response for math"></p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/school-success/school-success_29_0.png"  alt="Correlations between categorical predictors and the response for Portuguese"></p><p>Insights:</p><ul><li>Variables that impact negatively final grades in both datasets: in a romantic relationship (<code>romantic_yes</code>), does not want to go to higher education (<code>higher_no</code>), lives in a rural area (<code>address_R</code>) and has no access to internet (<code>internet_no</code>).</li><li>Variables that impact positively final grades in both datasets: not in a romantic relationship (<code>romantic_no</code>), wants to go to higher education (<code>higher_yes</code>), lives in a urban area (<code>address_U</code>), has access to internet (<code>internet_no</code>).</li><li>In Portuguese performance dataset, the <code>school</code> variable has a very high impact on the final grade (negatively impacted if goes to MS and positively impacted if goes to GP).</li><li>Males seem to score higher in math whereas females score higher in portuguese.</li></ul><h2 id="Visualizing-Key-Trends">Visualizing Key Trends</h2><p>Some of the results are quite unexpected so let’s visualize them.</p><h3 id="Effect-of-Address-Type-on-Grades">Effect of Address Type on Grades</h3><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/school-success/school-success_34_0.png"  alt="Impact of address type on student performance"></p><p>Insights:</p><ul><li>For math performance, there is not too much difference between urban and rural students.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p><strong>Accessing Post Source</strong><br>We are still working on getting this site set up, so source code for this post is not yet available. Check back soon and you’ll be able to find it linked here.</p></div><p>Testing, testing. One, two, three. Can everyone hear me alright?</p><p>Wonderful. Hello and welcome to the Warwick Data Science Society Research Blog. It’s so nice to see you.</p><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><h3 id="Testing-and-Tediosity">Testing and Tediosity</h3><p>Testing is boring. Everyone knows that they <em>should</em> test the solutions they produce, yet reality often fails to live up to this ideal. We check a few obvious things, run through the logic in our head, and convince ourselves that nothing could ever go wrong…and then it does just that.</p><p>Sometimes this is okay. For small, individual projects, it’s not the end of the world if your code base comes collapsing down on you; a few hours of bodging and everything should be stable again (all be it with code now so messy that you’d want to consider cryongenics). For larger projects, and especially those of collaborative nature, this just won’t do.</p><p>That is a long way to say, this post is a test, but hopefully not a boring one. To ensure that the testing of this site is performed thoroughly, I decided to write this post to ensure that everything is behaving as expected. I hope it can also act as a template for other keen researchers—whether they are currently a member of WDSS or merely interested in getting involved—to contribute their own work.</p><p>The philosophy of this post is to write about a topic that is actually (well, hopefully) of some interest to people, and do so in a natural way. None of this testing through enumerating corner-cases; let’s use the site for what it’s made for in practice and share some interesting insights along the way.</p><p>With that in mind, I wish to introduce to you: Gibrat’s law. Don’t be disheartened if you haven’t come across this term before,—most haven’t. This is likely because the rule is overshadowed by it’s far more infamous twin, the central limit theorem. If you’ve not come across this second term either, don’t fret. You may want to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNm3M9cqWyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this short video</a> by <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan Academy</a> as a preliminary, but we’ll introduce both of these ideas either way.</p><div class="note info"><p>As a matter of fact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibrat%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia article for Gibrat’s Law</a> is only made up of a few paragraphs with the link to the law’s creator, Robert Gibrat, directing you to a yet non-existant page. We seem to be diving head first into the rabbit hole today.</p></div><h2 id="Background">Background</h2><div class="note warning"><p>If you are already familiar with central limit theorem, you may wish to skip to the <a href="#from-sums-to-products">next section</a>.</p></div><h3 id="The-Central-Limit-Theorem">The Central Limit Theorem</h3><p>We’ll start with the central limit theorem. There are many ways of explaining or defining this phenomenon, each striking a subtle balance between statistical rigor and clarity of explanation. We will favor the latter, ensuring to remember that we should keep it too ourselves if we wish to avoid the disapproving gaze of the pure probability theorists.</p><p>This simplified description goes as follows:</p><ul><li>Consider a sequence of independent random variables</li><li>Take the sum of these values</li><li>Regardless of whether the original variables were normally distributed, the distribution of this sum will tend towards a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normal distribution</a> as the number of variables increases</li></ul><p>To clarify this notion, let’s look an example. One of the simplest would be an experiment involving tossing multiple fair coins. We consider each coin flip to be an independent random variable taking value zero if the result is tails, and likewise one for heads. We can then say that the total number of heads is the sum of these random variables. It would follow from the central limit theorem that the total number of heads should therefore tend to a normal distribution as the number of total coin tosses gets large. Let’s simulate this experiment for different numbers of coins and see this process in action.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/gibrats-law/gibrats-law_18_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Just as we expected, the more coins we toss, the closer the resulting distribution of heads resembles the classic bell shape of the normal distribution. Indeed, once we use around one hundred or more tosses, we can almost model the number of heads as a continuous variable.</p><h3 id="The-Importance-of-the-CLT">The Importance of the CLT</h3><p>It’s all well and good that the theory works, but why should we care?</p><p>The real power of the central limit theorem presents itself when we want to perform statistical analysis or tests on unfriendly distributions. The normal distribution has some incredibly delightful properties and has been studied in great extent, so working with it is often straightforward. On the other hand, there are many distributions which are not so cooperative, and that’s even assuming we know the distribution of whatever we are trying to model. Thankfully, the central limit theorem allows us to circumvent these issues by assuring us that as long as our process can be modeled as the sum of independent random variables (which is a surprisingly common property), we can approximate its distribution as normal and apply all of the standard techniques we know and love.</p><p>For example, the number of visitors to a website in a given time period is unlikely to have an underlying normal distribution governing the process. This could make it difficult to analyze data related to this, however the central limit theorem offers a workaround. The rough conceptual notion behind this approach is to divide our time period up into smaller and smaller intervals and consider how many people visit the website in each of those. We can assume that these are reasonably independent and so our total visitor count becomes the sum of many independent random variables and so the central limit theorem holds. A small caveat of this specific result is that we require the number of visitors to the site in the time period to be reasonably large (&gt;20 visitors is typically fine), but as long as this holds, we can perform analysis just as if our data was normally distributed.</p><div class="note success"><p>We can even go one step further. Since translating or scaling a normal distribution does not change its normality, it is possible to approximate many situations using the standard normal distrubtion (mean 0, variance 1) by applying appropriate transformations. This makes our lives even simpler and offers some elegance in the process.</p></div><h2 id="From-Sums-to-Products">From Sums to Products</h2><p>This leads us nicely onto Gibrat’s law. In our rough definition of the central limit theorem above, we described taking numerous independent random variables and computing their sum. Gibrat’s law begins in a similar vein but goes on to consider the product of these values instead. Because of this alteration, we can no longer expect the aggregation to approach a normal distribution as the number of variables grows large. Instead we tend towards a related distribution—the log-normal distribution.</p><p>As the name eludes to, a random variable following log-normal distribution can be defined by its logarithm being normally distributed. The converse of this framing is that whenever we take a normal random variable and take its exponential, the result will follow a log-normal distribution. Because of this, a log-normal random variable only takes strictly positive values with a density curve along the lines of the following.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/gibrats-law/gibrats-law_28_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Just as with our coin-tossing experiment for the central limit theorem, we can validate our belief in Gibrat’s law using another simulation. We’ll introduce an explicit example of Gibrat’s law in the final section of the post and for now look an a more esoteric example. In particular, we will consider numerous independent random variables, uniformly-distributed on the interval <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(0.5, 1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-.25em"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">.</span><span class="mord">5</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:.16666666666666666em"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>. We then take the product of the first <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span> these variables and look at the probability distribution of this value. Using Gibrat’s law we would expect this product to approach a log-normal as <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.43056em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span> becomes large, with a density tending in shape towards the curves shown above. A few simulations shows exactly that.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/gibrats-law/gibrats-law_30_0.png"  alt=""></p><div class="note success"><p>The example shown here is, admittedly, rather abstract. Despite this, it is still simple to frame it in terms of a real world problem (though perhaps not one of upmost importance). For example, we could imagine the product of independent uniform random variables modeling the process of repeatedly cutting a piece of string at a randomly chosen point along its length and retaining the longer part.</p></div><p>It is worth noting that just as there is no one normal distribution, but rather many of various shapes and sizes, parameterized by their mean (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.625em;vertical-align:-.19444em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">μ</span></span></span></span>) and variance (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>σ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:.03588em">σ</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:.8141079999999999em"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:.05em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>), the same is true for the log-normal distribution. In fact, we parameterize a log-normal distribution not by its own mean and variance, but by the mean and variance of the resulting normal distribution we obtain when taking logarithms.</p><p>This relationship between the two distributions offers us much of the same power the central limit theorem displays for Gibrat’s law too. Yes, taking the product of the independent random variables in its definition doesn’t give us the normal distribution we so desire directly, but with a simple logarithmic transformation we can get there. Further, because taking the logarithm of a random variable is a simple transformation with some desirable properties, we are able to utilize many of the tools we have developed for manipulating and analyzing the normal distribution with log-normal distribution. This in turn makes Gibrat’s law an incredibly powerful tool for simplifying statistical analysis. One question remains though: when does it hold? What sort of scenarios can be modeled as a product of independent random variables? This brings us neatly to the final section of this post in which we will look into just that, and confirm Gibrat’s law in action.</p><h2 id="Verifying-the-Law">Verifying the Law</h2><p>So far we’ve discussed some interesting ideas, but I think it’s time to pull things back from the land of statistical theory into the real world. Where would we expect to find Gibrat’s law in our lives?</p><p>The key insight needed to answer this question is to understand the underlying mechanism of Gibrat’s law; it’s all above the multiplication of random variables. Specifically, we take the previous product and multiply it by some new random amount. Another way of looking at this is that these random variables represent the growth rate of some quantity. Now, this is not a fixed growth rate as you would have say with interest rates or nuclear decay, but rather a stochastic growth rate.</p><p>To simplify this notion, all we are looking for is systems that evolve by a growth rate proportional to their current size with some added variation captured by the random nature of the variables. An example of such a system (and incidentally the original inspiration for the law) is that of modeling the growth of a firm. In a simple model, we can ignore the impacts of overarching market changes and catastrophic economic events and instead suggest that the growth of a company is roughly proportional to its current size with some added noise. Obviously, this model is primitive and its assumptions do not hold exactly, but it is close enough to believe that the distribution of the size of firms would indeed be log-normally distributed.</p><p>Another example could be the distribution of the population sizes for various countries or cities. There are clear troubles with modeling such a system using Gibrat’s law, but overall it is not unreasonable to suggest that the population growth of a city is largely dependent on its current size, with some added stochasticity. Don’t take my word for it though! Instead, let’s quickly gather some data to verify this result for ourselves.</p><h3 id="Sourcing-Data">Sourcing Data</h3><p>After some searching, I decided that the best data source to investigate the validity of Gibrat’s law for use with population data is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Wikipedia article</a> containing the populations of all sovereign states and dependencies. I then scraped relevant columns from the main table of this page, resulting in a dataset for which ten randomly chosen rows are shown below.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>City</th><th>Population</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>5</th><td>Manchester</td><td>503127</td></tr><tr><th>24</th><td>Southampton</td><td>236882</td></tr><tr><th>28</th><td>York</td><td>198051</td></tr><tr><th>31</th><td>Chelmsford</td><td>168310</td></tr><tr><th>32</th><td>Dundee</td><td>153990</td></tr><tr><th>51</th><td>Bath</td><td>88859</td></tr><tr><th>53</th><td>Hereford</td><td>58896</td></tr><tr><th>56</th><td>Stirling</td><td>34790</td></tr><tr><th>57</th><td>Lichfield</td><td>32219</td></tr><tr><th>66</th><td>London</td><td>7375</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Visualizing-the-Results">Visualizing the Results</h3><p>We can now plot a histogram of the populations for these cities. On top of this, we overlay a log-normal distribution with parameters chosen to best fit (using maximum likelihood estimation) to see how well the densities match.</p><p><img src="/" class="lazyload" data-src="/images/gibrats-law/gibrats-law_44_0.png"  alt=""></p><p>Now, before you say anything, I know. It’s not perfect. But, I hope we can agree that there is definitely <em>something</em> there. It’s also quite easy to explain why the match isn’t exact. For a start, we only had data for 69 cities so it’s no surprise that the histogram is so jagged. On top of this, city populations is one of the more difficult applications of Gibrat’s law due to the many factors that influence their size that aim to violate the assumptions of the rule.</p><p>Despite these shortcomings, it is clear that Gibrat’s law has value to it either as a conceptual or statistical tool. It should certainly be the case that the validity of the law in any particular scenario should be tested thoroughly before resting too heavy on the results, but as a tool to guide you in the right direction, it is is invaluable.</p><p>As eluded to above, the example of population data is more difficult than most applications of Gibrat’s law due to the numerous and influential externalities. I didn’t want to shy away from this case, especially when it is an example that has clear real-world implications for modeling. It therefore follows that in many more simplistic and controlled cases, Gibrat’s law shines even brighter. For example, it has been of great benefit in my work at AstraZeneca in forming suitable priors for energy distributions in statistical models. Without knowledge of this law it may have taken me more time to discover that the log-normal distribution was a natural and accurate model for these quanta.</p><p>If anything, this post does not offer anything of immediate practical use. That is not to say however that there isn’t an important message. That is, remember Gibrat’s law—it’s there more than you think, and your awareness of it is vital for optimum efficiency in your statistical work. I hope you found this post of some insight, and I look forward to sharing more ideas and research as this blog developments.</p>]]></content>
